# Test

## Test Driven Development

- Writing tests **before** writing code.
- Good code is easy to test.

**Bad design**
 
- Code isn't modular (preforms too many tasks).
- Not Modular:
    - Hard to Test.
    - Vulnerable to Bugs.
    - Hard to Understand.
    - Not Scalable.
    
**Test driven Development**

- Identify **meaningful** test cases.
- Write a unit test for each case:
    - Write a test that fails.
    - Make the test pass.
    - Refactor if necessary.
    
**Recap**

- TDD helps achieve a modular design.
