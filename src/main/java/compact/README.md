**Lambda expression**

- In Java, a lambda expression is a concise way of defining a **functional interface**, which is an interface that has 
exactly one abstract method. 
- A lambda expression is similar to a method, but it can be passed around as a value, assigned to a variable, 
or used in other ways that a method can't.
- A lambda expression has the following syntax:

```
(parameters) -> { body }
```

- The parameters are the input of the lambda expression, and the body contains the code that will be executed when the
lambda expression is invoked. 
- The parameters and the body are separated by the arrow operator `(->)`.
- An example of a lambda expression that is used to sort a list of strings:

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.sort((a, b) -> a.compareTo(b));
```

- In this example, the lambda expression `(a, b) -> a.compareTo(b)` is used to define a comparator that compares two 
strings by their lexicographic order. 
- The sort method of the List class takes a comparator as an argument, and it uses it to sort the elements of the list.
- Lambda expressions can be used to replace anonymous inner classes, which are classes that are defined and used in a 
single location. 
- For example, the following code uses an anonymous inner class to create a new thread:

```java
new Thread(new Runnable(){
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("Hello from the new thread");
    }
}).start();
```

- It can be re-written using a lambda expression:

```java
new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello from the new thread")).start();
```

- Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8, and they can be used in conjunction with functional interfaces, 
which are interfaces that has only one abstract method, to enable functional programming in Java.

**Function Interface**

- In Java, the Function interface is a functional interface that represents a function that takes in one argument 
and produces a result. 
- It is a part of the `java.util.function` package and has the following signature:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Function<T, R> {
    R apply(T t);
    ...
}
```

- The Function interface has a single abstract method apply which takes in an object of type `T` and returns an object 
of type `R`. 
- The Function interface can be used to represent a wide variety of functions, including mathematical functions, 
transformation functions, and so on.
- You can use the Function interface in combination with other functional interfaces such as `Consumer`, `Predicate`, 
and `Supplier` to chain together multiple operations. 
- It is also a common use case in functional programming where you can chain multiple operations together using the andThen and compose methods.
- Here are some examples of how the Function interface can be used in practice:
- Mathematical functions: 
    - You can use the Function interface to represent mathematical functions such as square, cube, etc. 
    - For example, the following code defines a square function that takes in an integer and returns its square:

```java
Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
System.out.println(square.apply(3)); // Outputs: 9
```

- String manipulation: 
    - The Function interface can also be used to manipulate strings. 
    - For example, the following code defines a `toUpperCase` function that takes in a string and returns its uppercase 
    version:

```java
Function<String, String> toUpperCase = s -> s.toUpperCase();
System.out.println(toUpperCase.apply("hello world")); // Outputs: "HELLO WORLD"
```

- Data transformation: 
    - The Function interface can be used to transform data from one form to another. 
    - For example, the following code defines a convertToPerson function that takes in a string and returns a Person object:

```java
Function<String, Person> convertToPerson = s -> {
    String[] parts = s.split(",");
    return new Person(parts[0], Integer.parseInt(parts[1]));
};
System.out.println(convertToPerson.apply("John,25")); // Outputs: Person{name='John', age=25}
```

- Chaining multiple functions together: 
    - The Function interface can also be used to chain multiple functions together. 
    - For example, the following code chains together the square and toUpperCase functions defined in the above examples:

```java
Function<Integer, String> squareAndToUpperCase = square.andThen(toUpperCase);
System.out.println(squareAndToUpperCase.apply(3)); // Outputs: "9"
```

- These are just a few examples of how the Function interface can be used in practice, but the possibilities are endless. 
- The Function interface is a powerful tool for functional programming and can be used to represent a wide variety of 
functions.

**Object oriented concepts**

- **Classes and Objects:** 
    - Classes are templates for creating objects, which are instances of a class. 
    - Classes define the properties and behavior of objects, and objects are the individual instances of a class.
- **Encapsulation:**
    - Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the implementation details of a class from other parts of the program. 
    - This allows the class to change its implementation without affecting the rest of the program.
- **Abstraction:**
    - Abstraction is the practice of focusing on the essential features of an object and ignoring non-essential details. 
    - This allows the developer to work with objects at a higher level of abstraction.
- **Inheritance:**
    - Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit properties and behavior from a parent class. 
    - This allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where a subclass can inherit properties and behavior 
    from a superclass.
- **Polymorphism:**
    - Polymorphism is the ability of a single function or method to work with multiple types of objects. 
    - This allows for the use of a single function or method with different types of objects, without the need for 
    explicit type checking.
- **Overriding:**
    - Overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined 
    in its superclass. 
    - This allows for the customization of the behavior of a class based on its specific needs.
- **Overloading:**
    - Overloading is the ability of a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. 
    - This allows for the use of the same method name with different types of inputs, making the code more readable.
- **Interfaces:**
    - Interfaces are a way to define a contract for a class, specifying the methods and properties that the class 
    must have. 
    - This allows for the creation of classes that conform to a specific set of rules, making them more interchangeable 
    and reusable.
- **Access Modifiers:**
    - Access modifiers are keywords used to control the accessibility of classes, methods, and properties. 
    - They determine which parts of the program can access a particular class, method or property.

**Docker Container**

- Docker containers are a key concept in the Docker ecosystem. 
- They are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient, making them a great choice for packaging and deploying applications. 
- Here are some key concepts related to Docker containers:
    - Image: 
        - A Docker container is based on an image. 
        - An image is a pre-configured and pre-packaged software that includes all the necessary dependencies 
        and libraries to run the application. 
        - The image is used to create a new container.
    - Container: 
        - A container is a running instance of an image. 
        - It is a lightweight and portable executable package that includes everything needed to run the application, 
        including the application code, system libraries, and runtime. 
        - Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system.
    - Namespace: 
        - Each container runs in its own namespace, which is a virtualized environment that isolates the container from 
        the host system and other containers. 
        - This allows multiple containers to run on the same host without interfering with each other.
    - Volume: 
        - Containers can also have volumes, which are directories or files that are mounted from the host system or other 
        containers. 
        - Volumes allow data to be persisted outside of the container and can be used to share data between containers.
    - Networking: 
        - Docker containers can be connected to each other and to the host system using a network. 
        - Each container has its own IP address and can communicate with other containers using the host's IP address.
    - Container orchestration: 
        - Docker containers can be managed and orchestrated using tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes. 
        - These tools allow for the management of multiple containers, scaling, and rolling updates.
    - Docker hub: 
        - Docker hub is a public registry where users can store and share their images. 
        - It allows for easy distribution and deployment of applications in a containerized environment.
- These are some of the key concepts related to Docker containers. 
- Understanding how they work and how they interact with each other is important for working with Docker 
and containerized applications.

**Dockerfile interview**

- A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. 
- It is used to automate the process of creating an image and ensures that the resulting image is consistent 
and repeatable. 
- Here are some key concepts related to Dockerfiles:
    - Instructions: 
        - A Dockerfile consists of a series of instructions that are executed in order. 
        - Each instruction creates a new layer in the image. 
        - Common instructions include `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ENV`, `EXPOSE`, and `CMD`.
    - Base image: 
        - The first instruction in a Dockerfile is typically `FROM`, which specifies the base image to use as a starting 
        point. 
        - This can be an official image from the Docker Hub or a custom image.
    - Layers: 
        - Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image. 
        - Layers are stacked on top of each other, with each layer building upon the previous one. 
        - This allows for efficient image management and distribution.
    - Environment variables: 
        - The `ENV` instruction can be used to set environment variables in the image. 
        - These variables can be used to configure the application or runtime.
    - Exposing ports: 
        - The `EXPOSE` instruction can be used to specify which ports the container will listen on when it is running.
    - Entrypoint: 
        - The `CMD` instruction specifies the command that should be run when the container is started. 
        - This can be overridden when the container is run.
- Building the image: To build an image from a Dockerfile, use the docker build command followed by the path to the 
Dockerfile.

```
docker build -t <image_name> .
```

- This command builds an image named `<image_name>` from the Dockerfile located in the current directory.
- Using the image: Once the image is built, you can use the docker run command to start a container from the image.

```
docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>
```

- This command starts a container from the `<image_name>` and maps the host port `<host_port>` to the container port 
`<container_port>`.
- These are some of the key concepts related to Dockerfiles. 
- Understanding how to use a Dockerfile is an important step in creating and managing Docker images. 
- The Dockerfile can be seen as a recipe or blueprint for building an image and ensures that the resulting image 
is consistent and repeatable.

**Example of Dockerfile**

```
# Use an official Java runtime as the base image
FROM openjdk:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Java program and its dependencies to the container
COPY target/my-java-app.jar .

# Expose the port on which the application will run
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Java program
CMD ["java", "-jar", "my-java-app.jar"]
```

- This Dockerfile uses the official OpenJDK 14 runtime as the base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, 
copies the `my-java-app.jar` file to the container, exposes port 8080, and runs the command `java -jar my-java-app.jar`
to start the application.
- You can build an image from this Dockerfile using the following command:

```
docker build -t my-java-app .
```

- And then you can run the container using the following command:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-java-app
```

- This will start a container from the `my-java-app` image and map the host port 8080 to the container port 8080. 
- The Java program will be accessible on the host's IP address at port 8080.

**Kubernetes**

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management 
of containerized applications. 
- Here are some key concepts related to Kubernetes:
    - Clusters: 
        - A Kubernetes cluster is a set of machines (physical or virtual) that are used to run containerized applications. 
        - A cluster is made up of one or more worker nodes and a single control plane.
    - Nodes: 
        - A node is a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster. 
        - Each node runs a container runtime (such as Docker) and the Kubernetes `kubelet`, which is responsible for 
        communicating with the control plane and ensuring that containers are running as expected.
    - Pods: 
        - A pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model.

        - Kubernetes supports different types of volumes, such as hostPath, emptyDir, and PersistentVolumes.
    - Namespaces: 
        - Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or projects. 
        - Kubernetes can be used to create multiple isolated environments within a single cluster.
    - Autoscaling: 
        - Kubernetes can automatically scale the number of replicas of a deployment based on resource usage, 
        allowing applications to handle varying levels of traffic.
- These are some of the key concepts related to Kubernetes. 
- Understanding these concepts is important for effectively using Kubernetes to manage containerized applications. 
- Kubernetes provides a robust and flexible platform for running containerized applications, 
and it is widely adopted by organizations of all sizes.

**OAuth 2 works**

- OAuth 2 is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their 
resources without sharing their passwords. 
- It works by allowing the user to authorize a specific application to access their resources on their behalf, without 
sharing their credentials.
- Here's a brief overview of how OAuth 2 works:
    - The user requests access to their resources from a third-party application.
    - The application redirects the user to an authorization server, which is operated by the resource owner 
    (e.g., the user's account provider such as Google, Facebook, etc).
    - The user authenticates with the authorization server and grants the application access to their resources.
    - The authorization server returns an access token to the application.
    - The application uses the access token to access the user's resources on the resource server.
- Here are a few concepts that might be useful in regards to OAuth 2 interview questions:
    - Access Token: A token that is issued by the authorization server and can be used by the application to access 
    the user's resources.
    - Authorization Grant: The process of obtaining an access token by the application, which is typically done through 
    a redirect to the authorization server.
    - Scope: A scope is a set of permissions that the application is requesting to access the user's resources.
    - Client ID: A unique identifier that is issued by the authorization server and is used to identify the application.
    - Client Secret: A secret that is issued by the authorization server and is used to authenticate the application.
    - Refresh Token: A token that is issued along with the access token and can be used to obtain a new access token 
    after the original one has expired.
    - Resource Owner: The person or entity that owns the resources that the application is trying to access.
    - Resource Server: The server that hosts the user's resources and validates the access token before allowing 
    the application to access them.
    - Grant Types: The different ways in which an application can obtain an access token, like authorization code grant,
     implicit grant, client credentials grant, password grant, and refresh token grant.

**Example of OAuth2 config in Java**

- An example of how to configure OAuth 2.0 in a Java application:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableOAuth2Client
public class OAuth2Config extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private OAuth2ClientContext oauth2ClientContext;

    @Value("${oauth2.clientId}")
    private String clientId;

    @Value("${oauth2.clientSecret}")
    private String clientSecret;

    @Value("${oauth2.accessTokenUri}")
    private String accessTokenUri;

    @Value("${oauth2.userAuthorizationUri}")
    private String userAuthorizationUri;

    @Value("${oauth2.redirectUri}")
    private String redirectUri;

    @Bean
    public OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails resource() {
        AuthorizationCodeResourceDetails resource = new AuthorizationCodeResourceDetails();
        resource.setClientId(clientId);
        resource.setClientSecret(clientSecret);
        resource.setAccessTokenUri(accessTokenUri);
        resource.setUserAuthorizationUri(userAuthorizationUri);
        resource.setScope(Arrays.asList("read", "write"));
        resource.setPreEstablishedRedirectUri(redirectUri);
        resource.setUseCurrentUri(false);
        return resource;
    }

    @Bean
    public OAuth2RestTemplate oauth2RestTemplate() {
        return new OAuth2RestTemplate(resource(), oauth2ClientContext);
    }

}
```

- This is a basic example of how to configure OAuth 2.0 in a Java application using Spring Security's OAuth 2.0 client 
support.
- The example uses the `@EnableOAuth2Client` annotation to enable OAuth 2.0 client support in the application. 
- It also uses the `@Value` annotation to inject values for the OAuth 2.0 client's ID, secret, and various URLs 
from properties files.
- The `resource()` method creates an instance of `AuthorizationCodeResourceDetails`, which is used to configure the 
details of the OAuth 2.0 client, such as the client ID and secret, the access token URI, and the user authorization URI.
- The `oauth2RestTemplate()` method creates an instance of `OAuth2RestTemplate`, which is a template class that can be 
used to make OAuth 2.0-protected resource requests.
- You can use this `OAuth2RestTemplate` instance to make OAuth 2.0-protected resource requests, like this:

```java
String url = "https://example.com/resource";
OAuth2RestTemplate oauth2RestTemplate = oauth2Config.oauth2RestTemplate();
String result = oauth2RestTemplate.getForObject(url, String.class);
```

- This is just a basic example of how to configure OAuth 2.0 in a Java application, you can customize it according to 
your needs, and add the appropriate scopes, redirects, and other configurations.
- Also, note that you should not put your `client_id`, `client_secret`, `redirect_uris`, and other sensitive data in 
the code, you should use an environment variable, or a configuration file and read them in runtime.

**Aspect oriented programming**

- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the 
separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
- A cross-cutting concern is a functionality that affects multiple parts of an application, such as logging, security, 
or transaction management.
- In traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), these concerns are often scattered across the codebase, 
making it difficult to understand the overall structure of the program and to maintain or modify it. 
- AOP allows for the separation of these concerns into distinct units called aspects, which can be independently reused 
and composed with the rest of the program.
- An aspect is defined using pointcuts, which are expressions that identify the join points 
(i.e., specific points in the program's execution) where the aspect's behavior should be applied, and advices, 
which are the actions that should be taken at the identified join points.
- AOP can be implemented in several ways, but it is most commonly done using AspectJ, a Java-based AOP framework that 
extends the Java language with new AOP-specific constructs such as pointcuts and advices.
- AOP can be used to achieve a number of benefits, such as:
    - Increased modularity by separating cross-cutting concerns from the main application logic.
    - Improved maintainability by reducing code duplication and making it easier to reason about the program's structure.
    - Improved scalability by allowing the addition or removal of cross-cutting concerns without affecting the main 
    application logic.
    - Improved flexibility by allowing the reuse and composition of cross-cutting concerns across multiple parts of the 
    program.
- It is important to note that AOP is a powerful tool, but it should be used with care. 
- AOP can make the codebase more complex and harder to understand if not used properly. 
- It's important to use it judiciously and in a way that it enhances the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

**Example in Java**

- The AspectJ framework is a powerful tool for implementing aspect-oriented programming (AOP) in Java. 
- Here is an example of how to use AspectJ to create an aspect that logs method execution times:
- First, add the AspectJ dependencies to your project's pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspectjrt</artifactId>
  <version>1.9.5</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspectjweaver</artifactId>
  <version>1.9.5</version>
</dependency>
```

- Next, create a new class called `LoggingAspect` and annotate it with `@Aspect`:

```java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {
    // ...
}
```

- Define a method that will be called before and after the execution of any method that is annotated with 
`@LogExecutionTime`:

```java
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Around("@annotation(LogExecutionTime)")
    public Object logExecutionTime(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Object proceed = joinPoint.proceed();
        long executionTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        System.out.println(joinPoint.getSignature() + " executed in " + executionTime + "ms");
        return proceed;
    }
}
```

- Create an annotation called `@LogExecutionTime` that you will use to mark methods that should be logged:

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface LogExecutionTime {
}
```

- Annotate the methods that you want to log with `@LogExecutionTime`:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    @LogExecutionTime
    public void doSomething() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

- Finally, register the aspect with Spring:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy
public class AspectConfig {
    @Bean
    public LoggingAspect loggingAspect() {
        return new LoggingAspect();
    }
}
```

- This is a basic example of how to use AspectJ in a Java application to log method execution times. 
- You can use similar techniques to implement other aspects, such as logging method arguments, handling exceptions, 
or adding security features.

***

**Annotations**

- Java annotations are a way to provide metadata information about a program's elements, such as classes, methods, 
and fields. 
- They can be used to provide additional information to the compiler, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or to other tools 
that process Java code.
- Annotations can be defined using the `@interface` keyword, and they can include elements, called members, that can be 
of various types, such as primitives, strings, or arrays.
- Annotations can be applied to various program elements, such as classes, interfaces, methods, constructors, fields, 
and parameters, by using the `@` symbol followed by the annotation name.
- Here is an example of a simple annotation called MyAnnotation that can be applied to a method:

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    int value();
}

public class MyClass {
    @MyAnnotation(value = 42)
    public void myMethod() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

- Java also provides several built-in annotations, such as:
    - `@Override`: Indicates that a method is intended to override a method that is defined in a superclass.
    - `@Deprecated`: Indicates that a program element is no longer in use and should be avoided.
    - `@SuppressWarnings`: Tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings that it would otherwise generate.
- Annotations can also be used in conjunction with reflection to inspect the structure and behavior of a program 
at runtime. 
- For example, you can use reflection to determine if a class has a specific annotation, or to get the value of 
an annotation element.
- Annotations are an important feature of Java and are used by many frameworks and libraries. 
- Some popular examples include Spring's `@Autowired`, JPA's `@Entity`, and JUnit's `@Test` annotations.

***

**Cohesion**

- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a module 
(such as a class, method, or function) work together to achieve a single, well-defined purpose. 
- High cohesion means that all the elements of the module are closely related to each other and work together to achieve 
a specific goal. 
- Low cohesion means that the elements of the module are loosely related and may perform unrelated or loosely related tasks.
- Cohesion is considered a desirable characteristic in software design because it helps to make a program more 
organized, readable, and easy to maintain. 
- Modules with high cohesion are more likely to be reusable and less prone to bugs, because all their elements 
are closely related to their main purpose. 
- Also, modules with high cohesion tend to be more flexible and easier to modify, because changing one part of the 
module will have less impact on the other parts.
- Examples of high cohesion:
    - A class that only contains methods related to a specific functionality, like a class that only contains methods 
    for handling a database connection.
    - A method that only performs one specific task, like a method that only performs a calculation
- Examples of low cohesion:
    - A class that contains methods for handling a database connection, and also methods for handling user input and output.
    - A method that performs multiple unrelated tasks, like a method that performs a calculation, opens a file, 
    and also sends an email.
- It is important to note that cohesion is a relative concept, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer on how much 
cohesion is enough. 
- The level of cohesion that is appropriate for a particular module depends on the specific requirements of the system 
and the design choices made by the developer.

***

**Java memory parts**

- Java uses a combination of different memory areas to manage the memory of a running program. 
- These memory areas include:
    - Heap: 
        - The heap is the main memory area where objects are stored. 
        - When an object is created using the new operator, it is allocated memory on the heap. 
        - Garbage collection is used to reclaim memory that is no longer being used by the program.
    - Stack: 
        - The stack is used to store method call frames. 
        - Each time a method is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack and when the method returns, the frame 
        is popped off. 
        - The stack also stores local variables, and the parameters passed to methods.
    - Method Area: 
        - The method area is used to store class-level information, such as the bytecode for methods and fields of classes.
    - Native Method Stacks: 
        - Native method stacks are used to store information about native methods, which are methods written in 
        languages other than Java.
    - PC Registers: 
        - PC (program counter) registers are used to store the current instruction being executed.
    - Non-Heap Memory: 
        - Non-heap memory is used for storing other data, such as the runtime constant pool and memory used by the JVM 
        itself, such as the garbage collector and JIT compiler.
- It's worth noting that the heap is divided into two parts: the young generation and the old generation. 
- The young generation is used to store newly created objects and the old generation is used to store long-lived objects. 
- The JVM uses a garbage collector to periodically clean up the heap and free up memory that is no longer being used.

**Java Garbage Collectors**

- Java has several built-in garbage collectors, including:
    - Serial GC: 
        - This is the simplest and default GC used in Java. 
        - It uses a single thread to perform garbage collection.
    - Parallel GC: 
        - This GC uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection, making it more efficient for larger heap sizes.
    - Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) GC: 
        - This GC performs most of its work concurrently with the application, 
        minimizing pauses caused by garbage collection.
    - G1 GC: 
        - This GC is designed for large heap sizes and uses a combination of techniques, such as parallel, concurrent, 
        and incremental collection to improve performance.
- You can specify which GC to use by adding command line options when starting the JVM. 
- It also depends on the heap size, number of cores and other system resources.
- You can specify which garbage collector to use by adding the following command line options when starting the JVM:
    - `-XX:+UseSerialGC`: This option specifies that the Serial GC should be used.
    - `-XX:+UseParallelGC`: This option specifies that the Parallel GC should be used.
    - `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`: This option specifies that the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) GC should be used.
    - `-XX:+UseG1GC`: This option specifies that the G1 GC should be used.
- For example, to start a Java application using the G1 GC, you would use the following command:

```
java -XX:+UseG1GC -jar myapplication.jar
```

- You can also use `-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags` to check which GC is currently in use.

**CMS GC**

- Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) is a garbage collector in Java that is designed to minimize pauses caused by 
garbage collection. 
- It works by performing most of its work concurrently with the application, while the application is running.
- The CMS GC operates in two phases:
    - Initial Mark Phase: 
        - In this phase, the GC identifies all the live objects in the heap. 
        - It starts by marking the objects that are reachable from the application's root objects 
        (i.e., objects that are reachable from the application's static fields and local variables), 
        and then recursively marks all the objects that are reachable from these objects. 
        - This phase can cause some short pauses in the application, but the goal is to minimize them.
    - Concurrent Sweep Phase: 
        - After the initial mark phase, the GC identifies all the objects that are no longer reachable and are eligible 
        for garbage collection. 
        - The concurrent sweep phase runs concurrently with the application, collecting the dead objects 
        and compacting the heap. 
        - The goal is to minimize the amount of time the application is paused.
- CMS GC is suitable for applications with moderate heap size and short GC pauses are acceptable. 
- It also performs well in environments with a high number of CPU cores and large amount of memory, 
but it can be less efficient with large heap sizes and high object allocation rates.
- Also, CMS GC have some disadvantages, such as high CPU usage, high fragmentation and can be prone to long pauses.

**G1 GC**

- The G1 (Garbage First) GC is a type of garbage collector that is included in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine (JVM). 
- It is designed to handle large heap sizes and reduce GC pause times.
- The G1 GC divides the heap into smaller regions and divides the regions into groups. 
- It then collects the garbage from the groups in parallel. 
- The G1 GC uses a combination of marking and copying to reclaim memory from dead objects. 
- It also uses a technique called "concurrent marking" to minimize the impact of GC pauses on application performance.
- The G1 GC also uses a technique called "mixed collections" to balance the amount of live data and the amount 
of garbage in the heap. 
- This allows the G1 GC to reclaim memory more efficiently and reduce GC pause times.
- In summary, G1 GC is designed to handle large heap sizes, reduce GC pause times, using a combination of marking 
and copying, concurrent marking, and mixed collections to reclaim memory more efficiently.

***

**static in Java**

- In Java, the "static" keyword can be used to indicate that a variable, method, or block of code belongs to the class, 
rather than to a specific instance of the class.
- When applied to a variable, "static" makes the variable a class variable, which means that there is only one copy of 
the variable that is shared by all instances of the class.
- When applied to a method, "static" makes the method a class method, which means that it can be called without creating 
an instance of the class. 
- These methods typically operate on class variables, or on the class itself.
- When applied to a block of code, "static" makes the block a static block, which is executed when the class 
is first loaded by the Java Virtual Machine.
- A static variable or method can be accessed using the class name, like `ClassName.staticVariable` 
or `ClassName.staticMethod()`.
- An example of a static variable and a static method:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static int staticVariable;
    public int instanceVariable;

    public static void staticMethod(){
        staticVariable++;
        //instanceVariable++;  //this line would cause a compile error, because it cannot access instance variable from a static method
    }
    public void instanceMethod(){
        staticVariable++;
        instanceVariable++;
    }
}
```

- In this example, the staticVariable is a class variable and can be accessed using the class name, 
like `MyClass.staticVariable`, and the staticMethod is a class method, which can be called using the class name, 
like `MyClass.staticMethod()`.
- It is important to note that static variables are shared by all instances of the class and should be used with caution. 
- Also, static methods can only access static variables and methods.
- In a multithreading context, the static keyword in Java refers to class level variables, rather than instance level 
variables. 
- This means that when a static variable is accessed by multiple threads, there is only one copy of the variable that 
all threads access. 
- This can lead to potential issues with concurrent access and modification of the variable, known as **race conditions**.
- Java provides the synchronized keyword to help manage access to shared resources, such as static variables, 
in a multithreading context. 
- When a method is marked as synchronized, only one thread can execute it at a time. 
- This helps prevent race conditions by ensuring that all threads access the shared resource one at a time.
- For example, if a static variable is being accessed by multiple threads, it is important to use synchronized method 
or block to protect it from concurrent modifications.

```java
class MyClass {
    static int myStaticVar = 0;

    public static synchronized void incrementMyStaticVar() {
        myStaticVar++;
    }
}
```

- It's worth mentioning that the static field can also be declared as volatile if you're using it as a flag variable, 
this will ensure that the variable is read from the main memory instead of local thread cache.
- In summary, when working with multithreading in Java, it's important to be aware of the potential issues with 
concurrent access and modification of static variables, and use the synchronized keyword or other synchronization 
mechanisms to manage access to shared resources.

***

**final in Java**

- In Java, the "final" keyword can be used to indicate that a variable, method, or class cannot be overridden or changed.
- When applied to a variable, "final" makes the variable a constant that cannot be reassigned.
- When applied to a method, "final" makes the method unable to be overridden by subclasses.
- When applied to a class, "final" makes the class unable to be subclassed.
- In addition to these uses, final can also be used for creating final local variable and final parameter variable.
- In Java, "final" can also be used to help ensure thread safety.
    - When a variable is declared as "final," its value cannot be modified after it is initialized. 
    - This means that if a variable is declared as final, any threads that access the variable can be sure that its 
    value will not change, which can help prevent race conditions and other concurrency issues.
    - Similarly, when a method is declared as "final," it cannot be overridden by subclasses, which means that any threads 
    that call the method can be sure that its behavior will not change, which can also help prevent concurrency issues.
- In addition to this, if an object is declared as final, it can be passed around safely in a multithreaded environment, 
because once the object is constructed, its state cannot be modified.
- It is important to note that declaring a variable or a method as final only ensures that the variable or the method 
cannot be reassigned or overridden, but it does not guarantee thread safety by itself. 
- It should be used in conjunction with other thread-safe practices and patterns like synchronization or immutability.

***

**Immutable in Java**

- An immutable class in Java is a class whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
- An example of an immutable class in Java:

```java
public final class ImmutablePerson {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public ImmutablePerson(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

- In this example, the ImmutablePerson class has two final fields: name and age, which are set in the constructor and 
cannot be modified afterwards. 
- It only has getter methods and no setters, so the state of an instance of this class cannot be modified after it's created.
- Because of this, instances of this class are safe to use in a multithreaded environment. 
- Since the state of the object can't be modified, multiple threads can access the same instance of the object without 
the risk of race conditions or other concurrency issues.
- It is important to note that an immutable class should not have any setters methods, otherwise it would be easy to 
modify the state of the class and make it not immutable anymore. 
- Also, for more complex class, it is important to make sure that any object references stored within the class are 
also immutable.

***

## Java multithreading

**Threads** 

- A thread is a lightweight unit of execution in a program. 
- In Java, threads can be created by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. 
- In either case, the `run()` method is the entry point for the thread's execution.
- Interview question: How do you create a new thread in Java?
    - Answer: You can create a new thread in Java by either extending the Thread class and overriding the `run()` method
     or by implementing the Runnable interface and passing an instance of that class to a Thread object's constructor.
     
**Concurrency**
 
- Concurrency is the ability of a program to have multiple tasks executing at the same time. 
- In a multithreading context, this means that multiple threads can be executing simultaneously.
- Interview question: How do you synchronize access to a shared resource in a multithreading environment?
    - Answer: You can synchronize access to a shared resource in a multithreading environment by using locks, 
    semaphores, or other synchronization mechanisms. 
    - For example, you can use the synchronized keyword to create a critical section of code that only one thread can 
    execute at a time, or you can use a ReentrantLock to achieve the same effect.
        
**Thread states** 

- A thread can be in one of several states, including new, runnable, blocked, and terminated. 
    - The **new** state indicates that a thread has been created but has not yet started.
    - The **runnable** state indicates that a thread is currently executing or is able to execute.
    - The **blocked** state indicates that a thread is waiting for a resource to be available.
    - The **terminated** state indicates that a thread has completed execution.
- Interview question: What are the different states that a thread can be in in Java?
    - Answer: A thread can be in one of four states in Java: new, runnable, blocked, and terminated.
        
**Thread scheduling** 

- The Java Virtual Machine schedules threads for execution using a technique called time-slicing. 
- Threads are assigned a priority, and the scheduler will run the highest-priority thread that is runnable.
- Interview question: How does the Java Virtual Machine schedule threads for execution?
    - Answer: The Java Virtual Machine schedules threads for execution using a technique called time-slicing. 
    - Threads are assigned a priority, and the scheduler will run the highest-priority thread that is runnable.
    
**Thread-safe data structures** 

- Thread-safe data structures are data structures that can be safely accessed by multiple threads without the need for 
explicit synchronization. 
- Examples of thread-safe data structures in Java include ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList.
- Interview question: How do you use thread-safe data structures in Java?
    - Answer: In Java, you can use thread-safe data structures, such as ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList, 
    to manage access to shared data. 
    - These classes provide thread-safe versions of common data structures that can be safely accessed by multiple 
    threads without the need for explicit synchronization.
    
**ThreadPool** 

- Thread pools are a way to manage a group of worker threads. 
- The Executor framework provides a simple way to create and manage a pool of threads.
- Interview question: How do you create a thread pool in Java?
    - Answer: In Java, you can use the Executor framework to create and manage a pool of threads. 
    - The framework provides several implementations of Executor such as ThreadPoolExecutor, 
    ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, SingleThreadExecutor etc. 
    - You can use these implementations to configure a thread pool with a specific number of threads, a queue for 
    holding tasks that are waiting to be executed, and a set of policies for controlling how tasks are executed.

**Inter-thread Communication**

- To communicate between threads, Java provides methods like `wait()`, `notify()` and `notifyAll()` that can be used to 
allow threads to wait for a certain condition to be met, and to notify other threads when that condition has been met. 
- These methods are defined in the Object class and they are used in conjunction with the synchronized keyword.
- Interview question: How do threads communicate with each other in Java?
    - Answer: In Java, threads can communicate with each other using the `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` methods. 
    - These methods are used in conjunction with the synchronized keyword to allow threads to wait for a certain 
    condition to be met and to notify other threads when that condition has been met.

**Deadlock** 

- A deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely because each thread is waiting for one 
of the other threads to release a resource. 
- Deadlocks can be prevented by using synchronization mechanisms such as locks and semaphores, and by ensuring that 
threads acquire resources in a consistent order.
- Interview question: How do you prevent deadlocks in a multithreading environment?
    - Answer: Deadlocks can be prevented by using synchronization mechanisms such as locks and semaphores, 
    and by ensuring that threads acquire resources in a consistent order. 
    - Additionally, one should be aware of the possibility of circular wait where thread1 holds resource1 and waiting 
    for resource2 and thread2 holds resource2 and waiting for resource1, in such case we can use a technique called 
    lock ordering.
    
**ThreadLocal** 

- A ThreadLocal variable is used to store thread-specific data. 
- It allows each thread to have its own copy of a variable, which is separate from the copies held by other threads. 
- This can be useful in situations where you want to maintain thread-specific state without using global variables.
- Interview question: How do you use ThreadLocal variables in Java?
    - Answer: You can use ThreadLocal variables in Java by creating an instance of the ThreadLocal class and then using 
    its `set()` and `get()` methods to store and retrieve thread-specific data. 
    - For example, you can create a ThreadLocal variable to store a user's identity and then use it to associate 
    a user's identity with the current thread.

**Volatile keyword**

- The volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable may be modified by multiple threads. 
- When a variable is declared as volatile, the Java Virtual Machine will ensure that all threads see the most up-to-date 
value of the variable by reading it from main memory instead of caching it in a thread-local storage.
- Interview question: How does the volatile keyword work in multithreading context?
    - Answer: The volatile keyword tells the JVM that a variable may be modified by multiple threads, and as such it 
    ensures that each thread reads the variable from main memory and not from a thread-local cache. 
    - This ensures that all threads have the most up-to-date value of the variable and prevent stale value problem.

***

**Enums, enums multithreading**

- In Java, an enum is a special kind of class that represents a fixed set of constants. 
- Enums are typically used to represent a small set of predefined values, such as the days of the week or the suits 
in a deck of cards.
- An enum is defined using the enum keyword, followed by a list of constants, which are called enumerators. 
- Each enumerator is an instance of the enum type, and they can be referred to by their names. 
- For example, an enum called DaysOfWeek might have enumerators for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.
- Enum constants are singleton by design, meaning that there can be only one instance of each enumerator created 
in the JVM. 
- Also, they are created at the time the enum type is initialized and are guaranteed to be initialized before any other 
thread accesses them.
- In a multithreading context, enum constants are thread-safe because of their singleton nature. 
- Because only one instance of each enumerator is created and initialized, there is no need to synchronize access to them. 
- Enum constants can be safely accessed by multiple threads without the need for explicit synchronization.
- It's worth mentioning that enum instances are also immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created, 
which eliminates the need for synchronization in most cases.
- In summary, enum constants in Java are thread-safe by design because they are singleton and immutable. 
- They can be safely accessed by multiple threads without the need for explicit synchronization.

**xargs linux**

- `xargs` is a command in Linux that is used to build and execute command lines from standard input. 
- It takes input from a command and passes it as arguments to another command. 
- The input is often a list of items such as file names or other data that is generated by another command.
- The basic syntax of `xargs` is: `command1 | xargs command2`
    - It takes the output of command1 as input and passes it as arguments to command2.
- For example, if you want to find all the files in a directory that match a certain pattern, and then delete them, 
you could use the find command to list the files and then pipe the output to `xargs` and the rm command:
    - `find /path -name "*.txt" | xargs rm`
- This will find all the `.txt` files in the directory `/path` and pass the list of file names to `xargs`, which then 
passes them as arguments to the rm command to delete them.

**Java object method**

- In Java, an object is an instance of a class, and it has several methods that can be used to interact with the 
object's state and behavior. 
- These methods are defined by the class, and they are inherited by all objects of that class. 
- The most common methods in Java objects are:
    - `toString()`:
        - Returns a string representation of the object. 
        - This method is called when an object is printed, and the default implementation returns the fully qualified 
        class name followed by the object's hash code.
    - `equals(Object o)`: 
        - Compares the object to another object and returns true if they are equal. 
        - The default implementation compares the objects based on their memory addresses, but it can be overridden to 
        provide a custom comparison.
    - `hashCode()`: 
        - Returns an integer that represents the object's state. 
        - The default implementation returns the object's memory address, but it can be overridden to provide a custom 
        hash code based on the object's state.
    - `clone()`: 
        - Creates a copy of the object. 
        - The default implementation creates a shallow copy of the object, but it can be overridden to provide a deep 
        copy of the object.
    - `finalize()`: 
        - Called by the garbage collector when the object is no longer reachable. 
        - This method can be overridden to release resources held by the object.
    - `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`: 
        - These methods are used for inter-thread communication and are related to the monitor concept. 
        - `wait()` causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the `notify()` or `notifyAll()` method 
        for this object. 
        - `notify()` wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. 
        - `notifyAll()` wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.
- These are some of the most common methods that are available in every Java object, but classes can also have 
additional methods depending on their implementation.

**Consumer Producer**

- The consumer-producer pattern is a design pattern that is used to manage the communication between multiple threads 
in a concurrent system. 
- The pattern is based on the idea of a shared buffer, where one or more threads (producers) produce items and store 
them in the buffer, and one or more other threads (consumers) take items from the buffer and process them.
- The consumer-producer pattern typically includes the following components:
    - A shared buffer: This is a data structure that stores the items produced by the producers and consumed by the 
    consumers.
    - Producers: These are the threads that generate items and store them in the buffer.
    - Consumers: These are the threads that take items from the buffer and process them.
    - A synchronization mechanism: 
        - This is used to coordinate the access to the shared buffer by the producers and consumers. 
        - This can be implemented using locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives.
- The consumer-producer pattern can be used to solve several problems such as:
    - Decoupling the production and consumption of items: Producers and consumers do not need to know about each other 
    and can work independently.
    - Reducing contention: By using a buffer to store items, producers and consumers can work at different rates and 
    can be decoupled from each other.
    - Improving performance: By using multiple threads to consume items, the overall throughput of the system can be 
    increased.
    - The consumer-producer pattern can be used in a variety of applications, such as multimedia streaming, 
    data processing, and event-driven systems.

**Design Patterns**

**The Singleton pattern**
 
- Is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global access point to that instance. 
- This is useful when only a single instance of a class should control the action throughout the execution.
- The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, while providing a global access 
point to this instance. 
- This is typically achieved by making the class's constructor private and providing a static method that returns the 
singleton instance. 
- Here's an example of a Singleton pattern implementation in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

- In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor, which ensures that no other class can instantiate it. 
- Instead, the class provides a static method `getInstance()` that returns the singleton instance. 
- The first time the method is called, it creates a new instance of the Singleton class and assigns it to 
the instance variable. 
- Subsequent calls to the method return the same instance.
- It is important to note that in a multi-threaded environment, this implementation is not thread-safe, 
so it will need to be synchronized. 
- Here is an example of thread-safe singleton pattern implementation in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

- Another way to implement thread-safe singleton is using double-checked locking, which is a more efficient approach 
to the previous one.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private volatile static Singleton instance;

    // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

- By using the volatile keyword, it ensures that multiple threads handle the singleton instance correctly when it is 
being initialized to the Singleton instance.
  
**The Factory pattern**

- The Factory design pattern is a **creational** design pattern in Java that provides a way to create objects without 
specifying the exact class of object that will be created. 
- The Factory pattern defines a method, which creates objects, but the classes that implement the method 
are not required to know which class of object it is creating.
- mHere is an example of the Factory pattern in Java:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Rectangle::draw() method.");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Inside Square::draw() method.");
    }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if(shapeType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        } else if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) {
            return new Square();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

- Here, the ShapeFactory class contains a method `getShape()` that returns an object of the requested class 
(Rectangle or Square) depending on the input. 
- The client code can then use this factory method to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object 
that will be created.

```java
ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("RECTANGLE");
shape1.draw();
Shape shape2 = shapeFactory.getShape("SQUARE");
shape2.draw();
```

- This way, factory pattern introduces an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of class to implement 
the interface to the subclasses. 

**The Observer pattern** 

- The Observer pattern is a **behavioral** design pattern in Java that allows one or more objects (observers) 
to be notified of changes to the state of another object (the subject). 
- This allows for a loosely coupled relationship between the subject and the observer, as the observer does not need 
to know the details of the subject's implementation.
- Here is an example of the Observer pattern in Java:

```java
interface Observer {
    void update(int value);
}

class ObserverA implements Observer {
    public void update(int value) {
        System.out.println("ObserverA: Value is now " + value);
    }
}

class ObserverB implements Observer {
    public void update(int value) {
        System.out.println("ObserverB: Value is now " + value);
    }
}

interface Subject {
    void registerObserver(Observer o);
    void removeObserver(Observer o);
    void notifyObservers();
}

class SubjectImpl implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<Observer>();
    private int value;

    public void registerObserver(Observer o) {
        observers.add(o);
    }

    public void removeObserver(Observer o) {
        observers.remove(o);
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer o : observers) {
            o.update(value);
        }
    }

    public void setValue(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        notifyObservers();
    }
}
```

- Here, the Observer interface defines a single method `update()` that will be called whenever the subject's state changes. 
- The Subject interface defines methods for registering and removing observers, as well as notifying them of changes to 
the state. 
- The SubjectImpl class is an implementation of the Subject interface that stores a list of observers, 
and calls the `update()` method on each one when its state changes.
- In this example, the ObserverA and ObserverB classes implement the Observer interface and print a message when they 
receive an update. 
- The client code can then create an instance of SubjectImpl and register ObserverA and ObserverB as observers:

```java
Subject subject = new SubjectImpl();
Observer observerA = new ObserverA();
Observer observerB = new ObserverB();
subject.registerObserver(observerA);
subject.registerObserver(observerB);
subject.setValue(5);
```

- This way, subject notifies the observer whenever there is a change in the state.
    
**The Decorator pattern**
 
- The Decorator pattern is a **structural** design pattern in Java that allows behavior to be added to an individual 
object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 
- It is used to add responsibilities to objects without inheriting from them.
- Here is an example of the Decorator pattern in Java:

```java
interface Component {
    void operation();
}

class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteComponent operation");
    }
}

abstract class Decorator implements Component {
    protected Component component;

    public Decorator(Component component) {
        this.component = component;
    }

    public void operation() {
        component.operation();
    }
}

class ConcreteDecoratorA extends Decorator {
    public ConcreteDecoratorA(Component component) {
        super(component);
    }

    public void operation() {
        super.operation();
        System.out.println("ConcreteDecoratorA operation");
    }
}

class ConcreteDecoratorB extends Decorator {
    public ConcreteDecoratorB(Component component) {
        super(component);
    }

    public void operation() {
        super.operation();
        System.out.println("ConcreteDecoratorB operation");
    }
}
```

- Here, the Component interface defines the operation that will be decorated, ConcreteComponent is an implementation 
of the Component interface that performs the basic operation, and Decorator is an abstract class that implements the 
Component interface and contains a reference to a Component object. 
- ConcreteDecoratorA and ConcreteDecoratorB are concrete decorator classes that add new behaviors to the Component 
object they decorate.
- In this example, a ConcreteComponent object can be decorated with one or more ConcreteDecoratorA and 
ConcreteDecoratorB objects. 
- The `operation()` method of each decorator is called in addition to the `operation()` method of the ConcreteComponent, 
allowing the behavior of the ConcreteComponent to be extended.

```java
Component component = new ConcreteComponent();
component = new ConcreteDecoratorA(component);
component = new ConcreteDecoratorB(component);
component.operation();
```

- This way, Decorator pattern allows adding new behavior to objects without changing their class.
     
**The Command pattern**
 
- The Command pattern is a **behavioral** design pattern in Java that encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for 
deferred execution or the ability to queue or log requests. 
- It separates the command execution from the command creation and allows the same command to be executed by different 
objects.
- Here is an example of the Command pattern in Java:

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class ConcreteCommandA implements Command {
    private Receiver receiver;

    public ConcreteCommandA(Receiver receiver) {
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    public void execute() {
        receiver.actionA();
    }
}

class ConcreteCommandB implements Command {
    private Receiver receiver;

    public ConcreteCommandB(Receiver receiver) {
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    public void execute() {
        receiver.actionB();
    }
}

class Receiver {
    public void actionA() {
        System.out.println("Receiver Action A");
    }

    public void actionB() {
        System.out.println("Receiver Action B");
    }
}

class Invoker {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void executeCommand() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

- Here, the Command interface defines a single method `execute()` that will be implemented by concrete command classes. 
- ConcreteCommandA and ConcreteCommandB are concrete command classes that encapsulate a request, in this case calling a 
specific action on the Receiver. 
- The Receiver class contains the logic that will be executed by the command, and the Invoker class is responsible for 
executing the command.
- In this example, the client creates the command objects and sets them to the invoker. 
- The invoker then calls the `executeCommand()` method which in turn calls the `execute()` method of the command.

```java
Receiver receiver = new Receiver();
Command commandA = new ConcreteCommandA(receiver);
Command commandB = new ConcreteCommandB(receiver);
Invoker invoker = new Invoker();
invoker.setCommand(commandA);
invoker.executeCommand();
invoker.setCommand(commandB);
invoker.executeCommand();
```

- This way, Command pattern encapsulates requests as objects, allowing for deferred execution and the ability to queue 
or log requests.

**The Adapter pattern**

- The Adapter pattern is a **structural** design pattern in Java that allows incompatible classes to work together by 
converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients. 
- It allows classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- Here is an example of the Adapter pattern in Java:

```java
interface Target {
    void request();
}

class Adaptee {
    public void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Adaptee specific request");
    }
}

class Adapter extends Adaptee implements Target {
    public void request() {
        specificRequest();
    }
}
```

- Here, the Target interface defines the interface that the client expects, Adaptee class is an existing class that has
 the functionality that we want to reuse but its interface is not compatible with the client. 
 - Adapter class is an adapter that converts the interface of the Adaptee class into the interface expected by the client.
- In this example, the client expects an object that implements the Target interface. 
- By creating an Adapter object, we can pass an Adaptee object to the client which can then call the `request()` method 
of the Adapter that will in turn call the `specificRequest()` method of the Adaptee.

```java
Target target = new Adapter();
target.request();
```

- This way, Adapter pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of 
one class into an interface expected by the clients.
    
**The Facade pattern**
    
- The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern in Java that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of 
classes, hiding their implementation details and interdependencies. 
- It allows the client to access the functionality of a subsystem through a single, unified interface.
- Here is an example of the Facade pattern in Java:

```java
class SubsystemA {
    public void operationA() {
        System.out.println("Subsystem A operation A");
    }
}

class SubsystemB {
    public void operationB() {
        System.out.println("Subsystem B operation B");
    }
}

class Facade {
    private SubsystemA subsystemA;
    private SubsystemB subsystemB;

    public Facade() {
        subsystemA = new SubsystemA();
        subsystemB = new SubsystemB();
    }

    public void operation() {
        subsystemA.operationA();
        subsystemB.operationB();
    }
}
```

- Here, the Facade class provides a single, simplified interface to a complex system of classes, hiding their 
implementation details and interdependencies. 
- The SubsystemA and SubsystemB classes are the classes that make up the complex system and would be difficult for the 
client to use directly.
- In this example, the client can access the functionality of the subsystems by calling the `operation()` method of 
the Facade. 
- This method will in turn call the `operationA()` and `operationB()` methods of the SubsystemA and SubsystemB classes, 
respectively.

```java
Facade facade = new Facade();
facade.operation();
```

- This way, Facade pattern allows the client to access the functionality of a subsystem through a single, 
unified interface, making the system easier to use and understand.
    
**The State pattern**

- The State pattern is a **behavioral** design pattern in Java that allows an object to alter its behavior when its 
internal state changes. 
- It encapsulates the behavior associated with a particular state of an object within a separate class, and the object 
can switch to a new state by changing its current state object.
- Here is an example of the State pattern in Java:

```java
interface State {
    void handle();
}

class ConcreteStateA implements State {
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("Handling in Concrete State A");
    }
}

class ConcreteStateB implements State {
    public void handle() {
        System.out.println("Handling in Concrete State B");
    }
}

class Context {
    private State state;

    public Context() {
        state = new ConcreteStateA();
    }

    public void setState(State state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public void handle() {
        state.handle();
    }
}
```

- Here, the State interface defines the behavior that the state classes must implement, ConcreteStateA and 
ConcreteStateB are concrete state classes that implement the State interface and provide specific behavior. 
- Context class maintains a reference to the current state, and it can change the state by changing the current state object.
- In this example, the client can create a Context object and set its initial state to ConcreteStateA. 
- Then it can invoke the `handle()` method on the Context, which will delegate the call to the `handle()` method of the 
current state object.
- If the client wants to change the state of the context, it can set a new state object using the `setState()` method on 
the context.

```java
Context context = new Context();
context.handle();  // Prints "Handling in Concrete State A"
context.setState(new ConcreteStateB());
context.handle();  // Prints "Handling in Concrete State B"
```

- This way, the State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, by encapsulating 
the behavior associated with a particular state of an object within a separate class.
    
**The Template method pattern**

- The Template Method pattern is a **behavioral** design pattern in Java that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in 
a method, called the template method, and allows subclasses to provide the implementation for some of the steps. 
- This pattern is often used to implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and leave it up to subclasses to 
implement the behavior that can vary.
- Here is an example of the Template Method pattern in Java:

```java
abstract class AbstractClass {
    public void templateMethod() {
        operation1();
        operation2();
    }

    abstract void operation1();
    abstract void operation2();
}

class ConcreteClassA extends AbstractClass {
    public void operation1() {
        System.out.println("Concrete Class A operation 1");
    }

    public void operation2() {
        System.out.println("Concrete Class A operation 2");
    }
}

class ConcreteClassB extends AbstractClass {
    public void operation1() {
        System.out.println("Concrete Class B operation 1");
    }

    public void operation2() {
        System.out.println("Concrete Class B operation 2");
    }
}
```

- Here, the AbstractClass defines the template method `templateMethod()` that provides the skeleton of an algorithm, 
including the order of the steps. 
- The `operation1()` and `operation2()` methods are abstract and must be implemented by subclasses. 
- ConcreteClassA and ConcreteClassB are subclasses that implement the `operation1()` and `operation2()` methods.
- In this example, the client can create an object of ConcreteClassA or ConcreteClassB and call the `templateMethod()` 
on the object, it will print the behavior of operation1 and operation2 that implemented in the concrete class.

```java
AbstractClass abstractClassA = new ConcreteClassA();
abstractClassA.templateMethod();
// Output: Concrete Class A operation 1, Concrete Class A operation 2

AbstractClass abstractClassB = new ConcreteClassB();
abstractClassB.templateMethod();
// Output: Concrete Class B operation 1, Concrete Class B operation 2
```

- This way, the Template Method pattern allows subclasses to provide the implementation for some of the steps of 
an algorithm, while the template method defines the skeleton of the algorithm and the order of the steps.
- It is a way to define an algorithm in a superclass, but let subclasses change or override some parts of the algorithm.
    
**The Iterator pattern**

- The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows traversing elements of an aggregate object 
(such as a list or a set) without exposing its internal structure. 
- In Java, the Iterator pattern is implemented using the Iterator interface, which is part of the Java Collection Framework.
- Here is an example of the Iterator pattern in Java:

```java
interface Iterator<E> {
    boolean hasNext();
    E next();
}

interface Aggregate<E> {
    Iterator<E> createIterator();
}

class ConcreteIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {
    private List<E> items;
    private int position = 0;

    public ConcreteIterator(List<E> items) {
        this.items = items;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return position < items.size();
    }

    @Override
    public E next() {
        return items.get(position++);
    }
}

class ConcreteAggregate<E> implements Aggregate<E> {
    private List<E> items = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public Iterator<E> createIterator() {
        return new ConcreteIterator<E>(items);
    }

    public void add(E item) {
        items.add(item);
    }
}
```

- In this example, the ConcreteAggregate class is an aggregate object that implements the Aggregate interface. 
- It has a list of items and a method `createIterator()` that creates and returns an instance of the ConcreteIterator class. 
- The ConcreteIterator class implements the Iterator interface and has a reference to the list of items. 
- It provides methods to check if there are more items in the list (`hasNext()`) and to return the next item (`next()`).
- The client can use the ConcreteAggregate and ConcreteIterator classes to traverse the items in the list:

```java
ConcreteAggregate<String> aggregate = new ConcreteAggregate<>();
aggregate.add("item 1");
aggregate.add("item 2");
aggregate.add("item 3");

Iterator<String> iterator = aggregate.createIterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    String item = iterator.next();
    System.out.println(item);
}
```
- This will output:

```
item 1
item 2
item 3
```

- In this way, the Iterator pattern allows traversing elements of an aggregate object in a consistent way, 
without exposing its internal structure. 
- The client can use the iterator to traverse the elements in the aggregate object, without knowing how the aggregate 
object is implemented.

***

**Testability**

- Testing code in an enterprise application can be a complex process, as enterprise applications often have many 
dependencies and integrations with other systems. 
- Here are a few common ways to test code in an enterprise application:
    - Unit testing: 
        - This involves writing individual tests for small units of code, such as a single method or class. 
        - Unit tests are typically written by developers and are intended to test the functionality of the code they 
        have written.
    - Integration testing: 
        - This involves testing how different parts of the application work together. 
        - This type of testing is typically done after unit testing and before acceptance testing. 
        - It can be done by developers, but also by a separate team responsible for testing.
    - Functional testing:
        - This type of testing is focused on testing the application's functionality from the user's perspective. 
        - It is done to ensure that the application behaves as expected and that all requirements are met.
    - Performance testing: 
        - This type of testing is focused on evaluating the application's performance under different loads, such as 
        high traffic, high data volume, etc. 
        - This is done to ensure that the application can handle the expected workload and identify bottlenecks.
    - Security testing: 
        - This type of testing is focused on evaluating the application's security. 
        - It is done to ensure that the application is secure and can protect against potential security threats.
    - Acceptance testing: 
        - This type of testing is focused on ensuring that the application meets the needs of the users and can be 
        accepted for use. 
        - It is typically done by a separate testing team or by the end-users themselves.
- These are just a few of the ways that code can be tested in an enterprise application, and the specific testing 
approach will depend on the application's requirements and constraints.
- The Spring Framework provides several libraries and tools that can be used to perform various types of tests on 
your application. 
- Here are a few examples:
    - JUnit: 
        - This is a widely used testing framework for Java that can be used for unit testing.
         - Spring provides support for JUnit through the spring-test module.
    - Spring Test: 
        - This is a library that provides support for testing Spring applications. 
        - It includes a variety of test-related annotations and classes that can be used to test Spring components,
         such as controllers, services, and repositories.
    - Spring Boot Test: 
        - This is a library that provides support for testing Spring Boot applications. 
        - It includes a variety of test-related annotations and classes that can be used to test Spring Boot components, 
        such as controllers, services, and repositories.
    - Spring MVC Test: 
        - This is a library that provides support for testing Spring MVC controllers. 
        - It allows you to simulate HTTP requests and test the controller's response.
    - Mockito: 
        - This is a mocking framework for Java that can be used to create mock objects for testing. 
        - It can be used in conjunction with JUnit or Spring Test to create test doubles for your application's dependencies.
    - AssertJ: 
        - This is an assertion library for Java that can be used to write expressive and readable test assertions. 
        - It can be used in conjunction with JUnit or Spring Test to write test assertions.
    - DBUnit: 
        - This is a library that allows you to test database-related code. 
        - It can be used to set up test data, test database queries and test stored procedures.
    - Apache JMeter: 
        - Is a powerful tool for load and performance testing. 
        - It can be used to simulate  high traffic loads on your application and measure its performance under different loads.
- These are just a few examples of the libraries and tools that can be used with the Spring Framework to perform various
 types of tests. 
 - Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to use additional libraries or tools.
- There are several code patterns that can help make your code more testable in Java. 
- Here are a few examples:
    - Dependency Injection: 
        - This pattern allows you to inject dependencies into a class, rather than having the class create them itself. 
        - This makes it easier to replace dependencies with test doubles, such as mock objects. 
        - Spring framework provides Dependency Injection through its core, and it is widely used in Spring-based applications.
    - Inversion of Control: 
        - This pattern is closely related to dependency injection, and it involves a separation of concerns between 
        a class and its dependencies. 
        - It allows you to write code that is more decoupled and easier to test.
    - Single Responsibility Principle: 
        - This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. 
        - By following this principle, you can write code that is more modular and easier to test.
    - Interface Segregation Principle: 
        - This principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use. 
        - By following this principle, you can write code that is more focused and easier to test.
    - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): 
        - This principle states that you should avoid repeating the same code in multiple places. 
        - By following this principle, you can write code that is more maintainable and easier to test.
- On the other hand, there are also certain code patterns that should be avoided in order to make your code more testable:
    - Global state: 
        - This pattern involves using global variables or singletons to store state that is shared across multiple parts 
        of the application. 
        - This makes it difficult to test the application in isolation and can lead to unpredictable behavior.
    - Tight coupling: 
        - This pattern involves having classes that are highly dependent on each other. 
        - This makes it difficult to test classes in isolation and can lead to brittle code.
    - Hidden dependencies: 
        - This pattern involves having classes that hide their dependencies, making it difficult to replace them with 
        test doubles.
    - Long methods: 
        - This pattern involves having methods with a large number of lines of code. 
        - This makes it difficult to understand the method's behavior and test it in isolation.
    - Code duplication: 
        - This pattern involves having multiple copies of the same code in different parts of the application. 
        - This makes it difficult to maintain and test the application.
- By following these code patterns and avoiding anti-patterns, you can write code that is more testable 
and easier to maintain.

**Liskov Substitution Principle Examples**

- The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a principle in object-oriented programming that states that objects of a 
superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- An example of the LSP in Java could be a class hierarchy where a "Bird" class is the superclass 
and "Penguin" and "Eagle" classes are subclasses. 
- According to the LSP, a method that accepts a Bird object as an argument should be able to accept a Penguin or Eagle 
object as well without causing any issues.
- Here is an example of how the LSP might be implemented in Java:

```java
class Bird {
    void fly() {
        // code to fly
    }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        // code to fly like an eagle
    }
}

class Flight {
    void fly(Bird bird) {
        bird.fly();
    }
}
```

- In this example, the Flight class has a method that accepts a Bird object and calls the `fly()` method on it. 
- Since the Penguin and Eagle classes are subclasses of Bird, they can also be passed to this method without any issues. 
- The Penguin class overrides the `fly()` method to throw an exception, but this does not affect the correctness of the 
program because the Flight class does not rely on the bird being able to fly.
- It's important to note that the LSP is not only about the type of object but also the behavior the object should have. 
- Object of a sub-class should be able to replace a object of the super-class without breaking the functionality.

**Terraform**

- Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
 - Here are some key concepts related to Terraform:
    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): 
        - Terraform allows for the definition of infrastructure using code, rather than manual configuration. 
        - This allows for versioning, testing, and collaboration on infrastructure.
    - Provider: 
        - A provider is a plugin for Terraform that interfaces with a specific service or platform, such as AWS, Azure, 
        or Google Cloud. 
        - Providers are responsible for creating, updating, and deleting resources on the corresponding service or platform.
    - Resource: 
        - A resource is a block of Terraform code that represents a specific piece of infrastructure, 
        such as a virtual machine, a database, or a load balancer. 
        - Each resource is created, updated, and deleted by the corresponding provider.
    - State: 
        - Terraform keeps track of the resources it has created, updated, and deleted in a file called the state. 
        - The state file contains information about the current state of the infrastructure, such as the ID of 
        a virtual machine or the IP address of a load balancer.
    - Plan: 
        - Terraform can create a plan of the changes that will be made to the infrastructure before they are applied. 
        - This allows for reviewing the changes before they are made, as well as testing the changes 
        in a staging environment.
    - Modules: 
        - Modules are a way to organize Terraform code and share common components between different configurations. 
        - A module is a collection of resources, variables, and outputs that can be reused across different Terraform 
        configurations.
    - Variables: 
        - Variables are a way to parameterize Terraform code, allowing for flexibility and reusability. 
        - Variables can be used to define values such as the number of virtual machines to create, 
        the names of resources, or the location of the resources.
    - Workspace: 
        - Workspaces are a way to organize and separate different environments, such as production, staging, 
        and development environments. 
        - Each workspace has its own state, and resources can be created, updated, and deleted independently 
        in each workspace.

**Questions**

1) What is Terraform and what are its main features?
    - Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that allows users to define and provision 
    infrastructure resources through a simple, human-readable configuration language. 
    - Its main features include the ability to provision resources across multiple cloud providers, 
    version control for infrastructure, and the ability to manage infrastructure as code.
2) How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?
    - Terraform has a built-in dependency management system that automatically determines the correct order to create or 
    update resources. 
    - This allows Terraform to create resources in the correct order, taking into account any dependencies that exist 
    between resources.
3) How does Terraform handle state management?
    - Terraform keeps track of the state of the infrastructure it manages using a state file. 
    - This file is stored locally or remotely and is used to reconcile the current state of the infrastructure with the 
    desired state defined in Terraform configuration files.
4) How does Terraform handle rollbacks?
    - Terraform has a built-in rollback feature that allows users to revert to a previous state of the infrastructure. 
    - This can be done by using the "terraform state" command and specifying the desired state.
5) What is a Terraform module and how is it used?
    - A Terraform module is a collection of Terraform files that are organized into a single directory. 
    - Modules are used to group together related resources, making it easier to manage and reuse infrastructure.
6) Can you explain the difference between Terraform and other IAC tools like Ansible and Puppet?
    - Terraform and other IAC tools like Ansible and Puppet are all used to automate the provisioning and management of 
    infrastructure, but they have different focus areas. 
    - Terraform is focused on provisioning and managing infrastructure resources, while Ansible is focused on 
    configuration management and Puppet is focused on automated management of servers.
7) What are some best practices for writing Terraform code?
    - Some best practices for writing Terraform code include keeping code organized and modular, using variables 
    and modules to make code more reusable, and testing code before deploying it.
8) How does Terraform handle changes to the infrastructure?
    - Terraform has a built-in system for handling changes to the infrastructure. 
    - When changes are made to the Terraform configuration files, Terraform will compare the current state of 
    the infrastructure with the desired state defined in the configuration files. 
    - It will then create, update, or delete resources as needed to bring the infrastructure into the desired state.
9) What is a provider in Terraform?
    - A provider in Terraform is a plugin that is responsible for understanding the API of a specific service or 
    infrastructure resource, and translating Terraform configuration into the appropriate API calls. 
    - Terraform supports multiple providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.
10) How does Terraform support collaboration and teamwork?
    - Terraform supports collaboration and teamwork through its state management and remote state features. 
    - Teams can use version control systems like Git to share Terraform configuration files, and remote state storage 
    can be used to share the state of the infrastructure across team members. 
    - Additionally, Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are paid offerings that provide collaboration features 
    such as remote state management, access controls, and team workflows.
    
**Terraform file formats**

- Terraform uses several different file formats to represent infrastructure resources and configurations. 
- The most common file formats are:
    - `*.tf files`: 
        - These are the primary configuration files used in Terraform. 
        - They contain the definitions of the infrastructure resources and their properties that Terraform 
        will create or manage.
    - `*.tfvars files`:
        - These files contain variable definitions that can be used in the Terraform configuration files. 
        - They allow users to define variable values that can be used across multiple configuration files, 
        making it easier to manage and reuse infrastructure.
    - `*.tfstate files`:
        - These files contain the current state of the infrastructure that Terraform is managing. 
        - They are used to ensure that Terraform is aware of the current state of the infrastructure, 
        and to ensure that changes to the infrastructure are made in the correct order.
    - `*.tfplan files`:
        - These files contain the execution plan that Terraform generates when it is run. 
        - The plan is a representation of the changes that will be made to the infrastructure, 
        and allows users to review the changes before they are applied.
    - `*.tfmodule`:
        - These files contain reusable modules that can be used across multiple Terraform configurations, 
        they are similar to functions in programming languages, they can be called with specific inputs and outputs.
    - `*.tfprovider`:
        - These files contain the provider configurations which are used to authenticate and connect to a specific cloud 
        provider or service, providers are needed to tell Terraform how to talk to the APIs of the different services.
- It is important to note that while Terraform files typically use the `.tf` extension, it is not required, 
you can use any extension you like.

**Terraform flow**

- Initialization: 
    - When you first run Terraform, it needs to be initialized. 
    - This step sets up the necessary files and data structures for Terraform to begin managing your infrastructure. 
    - This step will also download the necessary provider plugins.
- Planning: 
    - After initialization, Terraform will generate an execution plan. 
    - This plan is a representation of the changes that will be made to the infrastructure, and allows users to review 
    the changes before they are applied. 
    - Terraform will compare the current state of the infrastructure with the desired state defined in the configuration 
    files, and will create, update or delete resources as necessary.
- Applying: 
    - Once you are satisfied with the plan, you can apply it. 
    - This step will create, update or delete resources as necessary. 
    - Terraform will use the provider plugins to make API calls to the cloud provider and create or update resources.
- State management: 
    - After resources have been created or updated, Terraform will update its state file to reflect the current 
    state of the infrastructure. 
    - This allows Terraform to keep track of the infrastructure it manages, and ensure that future changes are made 
    in the correct order.
- Destruction: 
    - If you want to remove resources, you can use the terraform destroy command, this step will remove resources 
    and update the state file.
- Repeat: 
    - You can repeat the above steps as many times as needed, Terraform will always compare the current state of the 
    infrastructure with the desired state defined in the configuration files, and will create, update or delete 
    resources as necessary.
- It is important to note that all steps can be done via the command line or using Terraform's API and web UI. 
- Also, before provisioning any infrastructure, you need to set up the necessary credentials and permissions 
for Terraform to connect to your cloud provider's API.

**Bit manipulation Java**

- In Java, bit manipulation can be performed using bitwise operators such as `&` (and), `|` (or), `^` (xor), `~` (not), 
`<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift). 
- These operators can be applied to integers (int and long data types) to manipulate the individual bits within the 
binary representation of the number.
- For example, the `&` operator can be used to mask out certain bits in a number, the `|` operator can be used to set 
certain bits in a number, and the `^` operator can be used to toggle certain bits in a number.
- Here is an example of bit manipulation in Java:

```java
int x = 5;   // binary representation:  00000101
int y = 3;   // binary representation:  00000011

int z = x & y;  // bitwise AND
// z = 1, binary representation: 00000001

z = x | y;  // bitwise OR
// z = 7, binary representation: 00000111

z = x ^ y;  // bitwise XOR
// z = 6, binary representation: 00000110

z = ~x;  // bitwise NOT
// z = -6, binary representation: 11111010

z = x << 2;  // left shift
// z = 20, binary representation: 00010100

z = x >> 2;  // right shift
// z = 1, binary representation: 00000001
```

- It is important to note that the bitwise operator works on the bit level, if you want to shift the number k positions, 
you have to multiply or divide the number by `2^k`, depending if you are shifting to the left or to the right.

**Distributed Architecture**

- Distributed architecture in computer science refers to the design of a system that is distributed across multiple 
devices or machines, connected through a network. 
- In a distributed system, multiple devices work together to perform a single task or set of tasks, and share resources 
and information with each other.
- There are several types of distributed architectures, including:
    - Client-Server architecture: 
        - In this architecture, there are multiple clients that request services from a centralized server. 
        - The server manages and controls the resources and information, and the clients consume the services provided 
        by the server.
    - Peer-to-Peer architecture: 
        - In this architecture, there are multiple peer devices that act as both clients and servers, and can request 
        and provide services to each other. 
        - There is no centralized control, and each peer device is equal in terms of capabilities and responsibilities.
    - Microservices architecture: 
        - In this architecture, the system is broken down into a set of small, independent services that communicate 
        with each other through well-defined APIs. 
        - Each service is responsible for a specific task or set of tasks, and can be developed, deployed, 
        and scaled independently of the other services.
    - Cloud-based architecture: 
        - In this architecture, the system is built and deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure, 
        such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure. 
        - This allows for the system to be highly scalable and able to handle large amounts of data and traffic.
- Each of these architectures has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of architecture depends on the 
specific requirements and constraints of the system.
- Distributed architecture allows for better scalability, reliability, availability, and fault tolerance, 
as the workload can be distributed among multiple devices and resources can be shared. 
- It also allows for easier maintenance and upgrades, as individual components can be updated or replaced without 
affecting the entire system. 
- However, it also brings its own set of challenges such as network latency, network partition, data consistency and 
security.

**Availability**

- High availability in a distributed architecture can be achieved by implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms. 
- This can include:
    - Load balancing: distributing workloads across multiple servers to ensure that if one fails, others can take over.
    - Redundant servers: having multiple servers that can take over if the primary one fails.
    - Data replication: copying data across multiple servers to ensure that if one fails, the data is still available.
    - Monitoring and alerting: setting up monitoring and alerting systems to detect failures and take appropriate action.
    - Automatic failover: configuring systems to automatically failover to a redundant server when a failure is detected.
    - Disaster recovery: having a plan in place for recovering from a major disaster, such as a natural disaster 
    or cyber attack.
- Implementing these measures can help ensure that your distributed architecture is highly available and can continue 
to operate even in the event of failures.

**Reliability**

- High reliability in a distributed architecture can be achieved by implementing several key strategies, such as:
    - Error handling: designing systems to handle errors and exceptions gracefully, and to automatically recover from 
    failures when possible.
    - Monitoring and logging: setting up monitoring and logging systems to detect and diagnose problems, and to provide 
    valuable data for debugging and troubleshooting.
    - Versioning and rollbacks: keeping multiple versions of software and configurations, and the ability to easily roll 
    back to a previous version in case of problems.
    - Testing and validation: thoroughly testing systems and configurations before deployment, and validating that they 
    function correctly in a production environment.
    - Redundancy and failover: implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms, as described above, to ensure that 
    systems continue to operate even in the event of failures.
    - Communication protocol: using robust communication protocols that are able to detect and recover from errors, 
    such as TCP/IP and HTTP.
    - Service discovery: using service discovery mechanisms to ensure that all the nodes in the distributed architecture 
    can discover each other and communicate effectively.
- By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your distributed architecture is highly reliable and can 
continue to operate effectively even in the presence of failures or other problems.

**Scalability**

- High scalability in a distributed architecture can be achieved by implementing several key strategies, such as:
    - Loose coupling: designing systems so that components are loosely coupled, allowing them to be easily added, 
    removed, or replaced without affecting other components.
    - Horizontal scaling: adding more machines to handle increased load, rather than upgrading individual machines.
    - Stateless design: designing systems so that they don't maintain state, as this allows them to be easily replicated 
    and scaled out.
    - Load balancing: distributing workloads across multiple servers to ensure that if one becomes overloaded, 
    others can take over.
    - Caching: caching data and computation results in memory, rather than recomputing them, can increase scalability.
    - Data partitioning: partitioning data across multiple machines, known as sharding, can allow for increased 
    scalability as the amount of data increases.
    - Service discovery: using service discovery mechanisms to ensure that all the nodes in the distributed architecture 
    can discover each other and communicate effectively.
- By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your distributed architecture is highly scalable and can 
handle increased load without a significant impact on performance or availability.

**Data integrity**

- High data integrity in a distributed architecture can be achieved by implementing several key strategies, such as:
    - Data validation: validating data before it's stored or transmitted to ensure that it meets certain integrity 
    constraints, such as data types and required fields.
    - Data replication: replicating data across multiple servers to ensure that if one fails, 
    the data is still available, and to prevent data loss.
    - Data backups: regularly backing up data to ensure that it can be restored in case of failure or corruption.
    - Data encryption: encrypting data at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access or tampering.
    - Data consistency: ensuring that data is consistent across all servers, using techniques such as two-phase commit 
    or distributed consensus algorithms.
    - Data Auditing: Implementing an auditing mechanism to keep track of all data changes, who made the changes, 
    when and from where.
    - Error detection and correction: implementing mechanisms to detect and correct errors, such as checksums or 
    error-correcting codes, to ensure that data is transmitted and stored correctly.
    - Access control: implementing access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access 
    or modify data.
- By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your distributed architecture is able to maintain 
high data integrity, even in the presence of failures or other problems.

**Durability**

- High durability in a distributed architecture can be achieved by implementing several key strategies, such as:
    - Data replication: replicating data across multiple servers to ensure that if one fails, 
    the data is still available.
    - Data backups: regularly backing up data to ensure that it can be restored in case of failure or corruption.
    - RAID storage: using RAID storage systems to ensure that data is stored on multiple disks and can survive 
    a disk failure.
    - Data durability guarantees: using data storage systems that provide durability guarantees, such as write-ahead 
    logging or snapshotting.
    - Error detection and correction: implementing mechanisms to detect and correct errors, such as checksums or 
    error-correcting codes, to ensure that data is transmitted and stored correctly.
    - Data consistency: ensuring that data is consistent across all servers, using techniques such as two-phase commit 
    or distributed consensus algorithms.
    - Durable message queues: using durable message queues to store messages, even if the application or the message 
    broker crashes.
    - Cloud-based solutions: using cloud-based solutions such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, 
    which provide built-in redundancy and durability.
- By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your distributed architecture is able to maintain high data
durability, even in the presence of failures or other problems. 
- It is also important to test and validate your durability mechanisms by simulating failures and other scenarios.

**Robustness**

- High robustness in a distributed architecture can be achieved by implementing several key strategies, such as:
    - Error handling: designing systems to handle errors and exceptions gracefully, and to automatically recover from 
    failures when possible.
    - Monitoring and logging: setting up monitoring and logging systems to detect and diagnose problems, 
    and to provide valuable data for debugging and troubleshooting.
    - Versioning and rollbacks: keeping multiple versions of software and configurations, and the ability to easily roll 
    back to a previous version in case of problems.
    - Testing and validation: thoroughly testing systems and configurations before deployment, and validating that they 
    function correctly in a production environment.
    - Redundancy and failover: implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms, as described above, to ensure that 
    systems continue to operate even in the event of failures.
    - Communication protocol: using robust communication protocols that are able to detect and recover from errors, 
    such as TCP/IP and HTTP.
    - Service discovery: using service discovery mechanisms to ensure that all the nodes in the distributed architecture 
    can discover each other and communicate effectively.
    - Circuit breaking: implementing a circuit breaker pattern, which provides a mechanism to detect 
    and prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to a service that is experiencing issues.
    - Graceful degradation: designing systems to continue operating at a reduced level of functionality even if some 
    components fail.
- By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your distributed architecture is robust, able to handle and 
recover from failures, and continue to operate effectively even in the presence of problems.

**Robustness, what does it means**

- A robust distributed system is a system that is able to continue operating effectively, even in the presence of 
failures or other problems. 
- A robust distributed system typically has several key characteristics, including:
    - Fault tolerance: The system is able to tolerate failures of individual components and continue operating.
    - High availability: The system is able to respond to requests and provide service even when under heavy load or in 
    the presence of failures.
    - Scalability: The system is able to handle increased load and continue operating effectively.
    - Resilience: The system is able to recover quickly and efficiently from failures or other problems.
    - Security: The system is able to protect against unauthorized access or attacks and can ensure the data integrity.
    - Performance: The system is able to provide high performance in terms of responsiveness, throughput and data 
    integrity.
    - Manageability: The system is easy to manage, and it provides monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities.
    - Flexibility: The system can be easily modified or extended as requirements change over time.
- A robust distributed system is designed to be reliable, maintainable, and efficient, and is able to provide a high 
level of service quality, even in the presence of failures or other problems.

**Distributed system design tradeoffs**

- When designing a distributed system, there are several trade-offs that need to be considered. 
- Some of the main trade-offs include:
    - Consistency vs availability: distributed systems often need to make a trade-off between consistency, 
    which ensures that all nodes have the same view of the data, and availability, which ensures that the system is 
    always able to respond to requests.
    - Partition tolerance vs consistency: distributed systems need to make a trade-off between being able to tolerate 
    network partitions, which can occur when different parts of the system can't communicate with each other, 
    and consistency, which ensures that all nodes have the same view of the data.
    - Scalability vs fault-tolerance: distributed systems need to make a trade-off between scalability, 
    which allows the system to handle increased load, and fault-tolerance, 
    which ensures that the system can continue to operate even in the presence of failures.
    - Latency vs throughput: distributed systems need to make a trade-off between latency, which is the time it takes 
    for a request to be processed, and throughput, which is the number of requests that can be processed in a given time 
    period.
    - Cost vs performance: distributed systems need to make a trade-off between cost, which includes the hardware and 
    software expenses, and the performance, which includes the response time, throughput and data integrity.
    - Flexibility vs simplicity: distributed systems need to make a trade-off between flexibility, which allows for easy 
    modification and extension of the system, and simplicity, which makes it easier to understand and maintain.
- Each trade-off depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system and should be carefully considered 
to find the best balance for your use case.

**Limitations**

- Distributed systems have a number of limitations, some of the main ones include:
    - Complexity: 
        - Distributed systems are more complex than traditional systems, as they involve multiple components that need 
        to be coordinated and managed. 
        - This complexity can make it more difficult to understand, debug, and maintain the system.
    - Latency: communication between different components of a distributed system can introduce latency, which can 
    impact the performance and responsiveness of the system.
    - Consistency: maintaining consistency across all nodes in a distributed system can be challenging, particularly in 
    the presence of network partitions or other failures.
    - Security: distributed systems can be more vulnerable to security threats, such as network attacks or unauthorized 
    access to data, due to the increased number of components and communication channels.
    - Scalability: scaling a distributed system to handle increased load can be challenging, as it requires balancing 
    the needs of different components and ensuring that they can continue to work together effectively.
    - Testing and debugging: testing and debugging distributed systems can be more difficult than traditional systems, 
    as it requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between different components, 
    and the potential impact of different failure scenarios.
    - Interoperability: distributed systems can be composed of different technologies, or different versions of the same 
    technology, and thus, interoperability can be a problem if not designed properly.
    - Configuration and management: distributed systems require a significant amount of configuration and management 
    to ensure that all components are properly configured, updated and maintained.
- These limitations should be taken into account when designing and implementing a distributed system, 
and strategies should be put in place to mitigate them as much as possible.

**Simplicity**

- There are several measures that can be taken to add simplicity to distributed system design, some of the main ones include:
    - Keeping the system simple: Avoid overcomplicating the system by introducing unnecessary features or components, 
    and strive for simplicity in the design and implementation.
    - Using standard protocols: Utilizing standard protocols and technologies can make it easier to integrate different 
    components of the system and to understand how they work together.
    - Using a Microservices architecture: Microservices architecture breaks down a system into small, independent, 
    and loosely coupled services, making it easier to understand, develop and maintain.
    - Implementing modular design: Designing the system as a set of independent, reusable modules can make it easier to 
    understand and maintain, as well as easier to scale and evolve over time.
    - Automation: Automating repetitive tasks, such as deployment, testing, and monitoring, can help simplify the 
    management of the system.
    - Proper documentation: Proper documentation of the system, including architecture diagrams, and how-to guides, 
    can greatly simplify the understanding and maintenance of the system.
    - Adopting a simple data model: A simple data model can help simplify the system and make it easier to understand 
    and maintain.
    - Using a simple language: Using simple and easy-to-understand programming languages can help simplify the system 
    and make it easier to understand, develop, and maintain.
- By implementing these strategies, you can help make your distributed system design simpler, 
easier to understand and maintain, and more robust over time.

**Microservices**

- A microservice architecture is a method of developing software systems in which complex applications are broken down 
into small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.
- Each service runs a unique process and can be deployed, scaled, and managed independently. 
- This allows for more flexibility and scalability in the development and deployment of software systems.
- The key characteristics of a microservice architecture include:
    - Decentralized: Each service is its own independent unit with its own codebase, data store, 
    and set of responsibilities.
    - Loosely coupled: Services communicate with each other through APIs and do not share a common data store 
    or codebase, making them less dependent on each other.
    - Independent deployment: Services can be deployed, scaled, and managed independently, which allows for more 
    flexibility and scalability.
    - Automated testing: Services can be tested individually, which makes it easier to identify and fix issues.
    - Polyglot: Services can be built using different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, 
    depending on the specific requirements of the service.
    - Event-driven: Services communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages, which allows them to 
    operate asynchronously and independently.
    - Scalability: Services can be scaled up or down independently to handle changes in load.
    - Resilience: Services are designed to be fault-tolerant and can continue to operate even if one or more services fail.
    - Composability: Services can be composed to create complex applications.
    - Observability: Services are designed to be observable, meaning that it is easy to understand how they are 
    performing and troubleshoot issues.
- There are many technologies that can be used to implement a microservice architecture. Some popular choices include:
    - Containerization technologies: 
        - Docker and Kubernetes are commonly used to package and deploy services in a containerized environment. 
        - This allows for consistent and easy deployment of services across different environments.
    - Service discovery and registration: 
        - Technologies like Netflix Eureka, Consul, and Zookeeper can be used to automatically discover 
        and register services, making it easy for services to find and communicate with each other.
    - API Gateway: 
        - Technologies like Kong, Tyk, and Netflix Zuul can be used to handle API requests and route them to the 
        appropriate service.
    - Message queues: 
        - Technologies like RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and AWS SQS can be used to enable asynchronous communication between 
        services.
    - Service Mesh: 
        - Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect are examples of service mesh technologies that can be used to manage 
        service-to-service communication, load balancing, and traffic management.
    - Cloud-Native Platforms: 
        - AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure offer their own microservices platform solutions.
    - Programming languages and frameworks: 
        - Depending on the requirements of the services, different programming languages and frameworks can be used. 
        - For example, a service that performs image processing might be implemented in Python using the TensorFlow 
        library, while a service that handles data storage might be implemented in Java using Spring Boot.
    - Monitoring and logging: Technologies like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack can be used to monitor and log the 
    performance and behavior of services, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.

**Postgres**

- PostgreSQL (often simply called "Postgres") is an open-source relational database management system. 
- Here are some key concepts and features of Postgres:
    - SQL support: Postgres supports a large portion of the SQL standard, making it compatible with a wide range of 
    applications and tools.
    - Data Types: Postgres supports a wide variety of data types, including standard SQL types such as integers, 
    floating-point numbers, and strings, as well as more advanced types such as arrays, hstore (a key-value store), 
    and JSON.
    - Indexes: Postgres supports several types of indexes, including B-tree, Hash, and GiST (Generalized Search Tree), 
    which can be used to improve the performance of queries.
    - Concurrency: 
        - Postgres uses a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) system, which allows for concurrent access to the 
        same data without the need for locks. 
        - This improves performance, but it can make it more difficult to write certain types of queries.
    - ACID Compliance: Postgres is fully ACID compliant, which means that it guarantees the atomicity, consistency, 
    isolation, and durability of transactions.
    - Extensibility: 
        - Postgres is highly extensible, with support for user-defined functions, operators, and data types. 
        - This allows developers to add custom functionality to the database, such as full-text search or geographic 
        data support.
    - Replication: Postgres supports several types of replication, including streaming replication, logical replication, 
    file-based replication and pgpool-II.
    - Security: Postgres provides a robust set of security features, including support for user authentication, 
    role-based access control, and encryption.
- In summary, Postgres is a powerful and flexible open-source relational database management system that supports a wide 
variety of data types and has many advanced features such as replication, extensibility, and security.

**Questions**

1) What is a relational database and how does it differ from other types of databases?
    - A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables with rows and columns. 
    - It uses relationships between tables to link data together, which allows for more efficient querying and data 
    integrity. 
    - Relational databases differ from other types of databases, such as document databases or key-value stores, 
    which do not have the same level of structure and relationships.
2) Explain the ACID properties of a database transaction.
    - ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 
    - Atomicity means that a transaction is either fully completed or fully rolled back, so the data remains in a 
    consistent state. 
    - Consistency means that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another valid state. 
    - Isolation means that a transaction is isolated from other transactions, and its changes are not visible to other 
    transactions until it is committed. 
    - Durability means that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and will survive any subsequent 
    failures.
3) Describe the process of normalization and why it is important.
    - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database so that it is in the most efficient and 
    consistent form possible. 
    - This includes breaking down data into separate tables, and using relationships between those tables to link data 
    together. 
    - Normalization is important because it helps to eliminate data redundancy, improve data integrity, and make it 
    easier to query and update the data.
4) What is an index in a database and why is it important?
    - An index is a data structure that allows for faster searching of data in a table. 
    - It creates a separate, smaller table of data that is organized in a way that makes searching faster. 
    - Indexes are important because they can greatly improve the performance of queries, especially on large tables.
5) Explain the difference between a primary key and a foreign key.
    - A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. 
    - It is used to enforce the integrity of the data and to create relationships between tables. 
    - A foreign key is a field in one table that is used to reference the primary key of another table. 
    - It is used to create a link between the data in two tables and to enforce referential integrity.
6) Explain the process of SQL query optimization and how it can be used to improve performance.
    - SQL query optimization is the process of improving the performance of a SQL query by analyzing and modifying the 
    query and the database structure. 
    - This can include things like creating indexes, rewriting the query, or modifying the database schema. 
    - Query optimization can be used to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed 
    and by making the query more efficient.
7) Explain the concept of a view in a relational database.
    - A view in a relational database is a virtual table that is defined by a SELECT statement. 
    - It does not store data itself but instead references the data stored in other tables. 
    - Views can be used to simplify queries, to limit the data exposed to users, and to implement security.
8) How does Postgres handle concurrency and locking?
    - Postgres uses a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) system to handle concurrency. 
    - This means that each transaction sees a snapshot of the data as it existed at the start of the transaction, 
    and any changes made by other transactions are not visible until they are committed. 
    - This allows for concurrent access to the same data without the need for locks, which improves performance. 
    - However, this can make it more difficult to write certain types of queries.
9) Explain the difference between a clustered index and a non-clustered index in Postgres.
    - A clustered index is an index that physically reorders the rows of a table based on the indexed columns. 
    - This makes it more efficient for queries that retrieve data based on the indexed columns. 
    - A non-clustered index, on the other hand, does not physically reorder the rows of a table. 
    - Instead, it creates a separate data structure that maps the indexed columns to the locations of the corresponding 
    rows in the table. 
    - This can be more efficient for queries that retrieve data based on non-indexed columns.
10) How does Postgres handle replication and what are the different replication strategies?
    - Postgres supports several types of replication, including streaming replication, logical replication, 
    file-based replication and pgpool-II. 
    - Streaming replication is a synchronous replication method that streams data changes from the master to one or more 
    replica servers in real-time. 
    - Logical replication, uses a publish-subscribe model to replicate data changes. 
    - File-based replication use a file based mechanism to replicate data and pgpool-II is a connection pooler and a 
    proxy server for PostgreSQL.
11) Explain the concept of a Trigger in Postgres and give an example of a use case for a trigger.
    - A trigger in Postgres is a set of actions that are automatically executed in response to specific events, 
    such as a table update or a data insertion. 
    - Triggers can be used to enforce business rules, perform auditing, and maintain data integrity. 
    - For example, you could use a trigger to automatically update a timestamp field in a table whenever 
    a row is updated, or to automatically log changes to a specific table in an audit table.
12) How does Postgres handle indexing and how can you optimize indexing for a query?
    - Postgres supports several types of indexes, including B-tree, Hash, and GiST (Generalized Search Tree). 
    - Indexing can be optimized by creating indexes on the columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses, 
    by creating indexes on columns that are used in JOIN clauses, and by avoiding creating unnecessary indexes. 
    - You can also use the EXPLAIN command to analyze the execution plan of a query and identify which indexes are being 
    used and which are not.
    
**Joins**

- In Postgres, a join operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. 
- There are several types of join operations, including:
    - `INNER JOIN`: 
        - This is the most commonly used join operation. 
        - It returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
    - `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`): 
        - This returns all rows from the left table, and the matching rows from the right table. 
        - If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for the right table's columns.
    - `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`): 
        - This returns all rows from the right table, and the matching rows from the left table. 
        - If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for the left table's columns.
    - `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`): 
        - This returns all rows from both tables, and returns NULL values for the non-matching columns.
    - `CROSS JOIN`: 
        - This returns the Cartesian product of two tables, which is the set of all possible combinations of rows 
        between the two tables.
- In order to optimize join performance, you can use the right type of join according to your requirement, 
use indexes on the join columns and make sure that the join columns have the same data types.
- Additionally, Postgres allows you to perform subquery in the `FROM` clause, which is also known as a subselect or 
derived table. 
- This allows you to join the results of a query to another table.

**SELECT** 

- This command is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database. 
- The basic syntax of the `SELECT` command is as follows:

```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
[WHERE condition]
[GROUP BY column1, column2, ...]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY column1, column2, ...]
```

**INSERT**
 
- This command is used to add new rows of data to a table. 
- The basic syntax of the `INSERT` command is as follows:

```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...)
```

**UPDATE** 

- This command is used to modify existing data in a table. 
- The basic syntax of the `UPDATE` command is as follows:

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
[WHERE condition]
```

**DELETE** 

- This command is used to delete existing data in a table. 
- The basic syntax of the `DELETE` command is as follows:
```
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
```

**CREATE** 

- This command is used to create a new table, index, view, or other database object. 
- The basic syntax of the `CREATE` command is as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE table_name
(
column1 data_type constraint,
column2 data_type constraint,
...
);
```

**ALTER** 

- This command is used to alter the structure of an existing table, index, view, or other database object. 
- The basic syntax of the `ALTER` command is as follows:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name data_type constraint;
```

**DROP** 

- This command is used to delete an existing table, index, view, or other database object. 
- The basic syntax of the `DROP` command is as follows:

```
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

**EXPLAIN** 

- This command is used to analyze the execution plan of a query and understand how the query is executed. 
- The basic syntax of the `EXPLAIN` command is as follows:

```
EXPLAIN SELECT ...
```


**INNER JOIN** 

- This example retrieves all the rows where the values in the "id" column of the "orders" table match the values in the 
"id" column of the "customers" table.

```
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers
ON orders.id = customers.id;
```

**LEFT JOIN** 

- This example retrieves all the rows from the "orders" table, and the matching rows from the "customers" table. 
- If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for the "customers" table's columns.

```
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers
ON orders.id = customers.id;
```

**RIGHT JOIN** 

- This example retrieves all the rows from the "customers" table, and the matching rows from the "orders" table. 
- If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for the "orders" table's columns.

```
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers
ON orders.id = customers.id;
```

**FULL JOIN** 

- This example retrieves all the rows from both the "orders" and "customers" tables, and returns NULL values for the 
non-matching columns.

```
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
FULL OUTER JOIN customers
ON orders.id = customers.id;
```

**CROSS JOIN** 

- This example returns the Cartesian product of the "orders" and "customers" tables, which is the set of all possible c
ombinations of rows between the two tables.

```
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM orders
CROSS JOIN customers;
```

- Also, in postgres, in addition to these join types, you can use subquery in the FROM clause, which is also known as a
 subselect or derived table. 
 - This allows you to join the results of a query to another table.

```java
SELECT orders.id, customers.name
FROM (SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2022-01-01') as orders
JOIN customers
ON orders.id = customers.id;
```

**MongoDB**

- MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database that uses a flexible schema and stores data in a binary 
JSON (BSON) format. 
- Some key concepts to understand when working with MongoDB include:
    - Collections: 
        - MongoDB stores data in collections, which are similar to tables in a relational database. 
        - Each collection can contain any number of documents.
    - Documents: 
        - MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to rows in a relational database. 
        - Each document is a set of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any valid BSON 
        data type (e.g. strings, numbers, arrays, etc.).
    - Schemaless: 
        - MongoDB is schemaless, which means that documents within a collection can have different fields, and the 
        fields in a document can be of different types.
    - Indexes: 
        - MongoDB supports indexing to improve query performance. 
        - Indexes can be created on any field in a document, and there are several types of indexes available, 
        including single-field, compound, and text indexes.
    - Aggregation: 
        - MongoDB provides an Aggregation Framework that allows you to perform complex data processing and analysis on 
        your data. 
        - This can be used for tasks such as filtering, grouping, and summarizing data.
    - Replication and Sharding: 
        - MongoDB supports both replication and sharding to provide high availability and horizontal scalability. 
        - Replication allows you to create multiple copies of your data for redundancy, while sharding allows you to 
        distribute your data across multiple servers.
- A document-oriented database is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents, 
rather than in tables with rows and columns as in traditional relational databases. 
- Each document is a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be 
any valid data type, such as numbers, strings, arrays, and even other documents.
- In a document-oriented database, each document is self-contained and contains all the information that is necessary to u
nderstand and use the data. 
- This allows for a more flexible and dynamic data model, as each document can have its own unique structure and fields.
- This approach allows for more natural data modeling, as it allows the data to be stored in a way that closely matches 
the structure of the objects and the relationships between them in the application. 
- Additionally, it allows for more efficient querying, as the database only needs to look at the specific document 
being queried, rather than scanning entire tables as in relational databases.
- MongoDB, Couchbase, and RavenDB are examples of document-oriented databases.

**Questions**

1) What is MongoDB and what are some of its key features?
    - MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database that uses a flexible schema and stores data in a binary 
    JSON (BSON) format. 
    - Some of its key features include its scalability, high performance, support for rich data types, and built-in 
    support for horizontal scaling through sharding.
2) Explain the difference between MongoDB and a relational database.
    - MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database while relational databases like MySQL, Oracle and SQL server 
    are based on the relational model. 
    - MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to rows in a relational database, but each document can have 
    a different structure and fields. 
    - MongoDB does not enforce a schema, whereas relational databases have a predefined schema. 
    - MongoDB does not support relationships between collections, whereas relational databases support relationships 
    between tables.
3) How does MongoDB ensure data consistency and handle data conflicts?
    - MongoDB uses a technique called "two-phase commit" to ensure data consistency across multiple replica sets. 
    - It also supports write concern and read concern to control the level of data consistency that is required for a 
    specific operation. 
    - In the event of a data conflict, MongoDB uses a "last write wins" strategy, where the most recent write will 
    overwrite any previous writes.
4) How do you optimize MongoDB performance?
    - Some ways to optimize MongoDB performance include:
        - Creating indexes on frequently queried fields
        - Using appropriate data types and structures
        - Partitioning or sharding large collections
        - Properly configuring memory and disk settings
        - Monitoring and analyzing performance metrics using the MongoDB profiler and other tools
        - How do you handle data migration in MongoDB?
5) Data migration in MongoDB can be handled by using the following methods:
    - MongoDB's built-in export and import tools, such as `mongodump` and `mongorestore`
    - The MongoDB Connector for BI, which allows you to use SQL to query MongoDB data
    - Using a tool like Mongoose to write custom scripts for migrating data
    - Using a third-party tool like MongoDB's Atlas Data Migration Service
6) How would you design a shard key for a MongoDB collection?
    - When designing a shard key, it is important to consider the following factors:
        - The shard key should be based on the query patterns of the application
        - The shard key should be immutable, so that it does not change after the data is inserted
        - The shard key should be unique, so that it guarantees a good distribution of data across the shards.
        - It's also important to consider how the shard key value will be distributed across the cluster, 
        and whether it will lead to an even distribution of data, or if it will lead to hot spots.
7) How do you implement a full-text search in MongoDB?
    - One way to implement full-text search in MongoDB is to use the `$text` operator in combination with a text index. 
    - To create a text index, you can use the `db.collection.createIndex()` method, and specify the fields that you want 
    to include in the index and set the "text" option to true.
    - For example, to create a text index on the "title" and "description" fields of a "products" collection, 
    you would use the following command:
    ```
    db.products.createIndex( { title: "text", description: "text" } )
    ```
    - Then, to perform a text search, you would use the `$text` operator in a query, along with the `$search` operator 
    to specify the search terms. 
    - For example, to search for products with the word "laptop" in the title or description, you would use 
    the following query:
    ```
    db.products.find( { $text: { $search: "laptop" } } )
    ```
8) How do you implement a geospatial search in MongoDB?
    - MongoDB supports a number of geospatial data types and operators, including 2dsphere and 2d indexes, that can be 
    used to perform geospatial queries. 
    - To implement a geospatial search, you need to first create a geospatial index on the field that contains the 
    location data, using the `db.collection.createIndex()` method.
    - For example, to create a 2dsphere index on the "location" field of a "places" collection, 
    you would use the following command:
    ```
    db.places.createIndex( { location: "2dsphere" } )
    ```
    - Then, you can use the `$geoWithin` or `$near` operators in a query to find documents that match a specific 
    location or are within a certain distance of a specific location. 
    - For example, to find all the places within 2km of a specific location, you would use the following query:
    ```
    db.places.find( { location: { $near: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] }, $maxDistance: 2000 } } } )
    ```
9) How would you design a MongoDB database for a social media application?
    - When designing a MongoDB database for a social media application, it is important to consider the following factors:
        - The data model should be flexible and easily adaptable to changing requirements.
        - The database should be designed to handle a high volume of read and write operations.
        - The database should be easily scalable.
        - The database should be able to handle large amounts of unstructured data, such as text, images and videos.
        - One possible approach for designing the database is to use a collection for user information, a collection 
        for posts and a collection for comments. 
        - The user collection would contain information such as the user's name, email, and profile picture. 
        - The post collection would contain information such as the post's text, image or video, and timestamp.
        - The comments collection would contain information such as the comment's text and timestamp.
        - To handle the high-read and write operations we can implement sharding and indexing to improve the performance, 
        and use replica sets to ensure high availability and data durability.

**MongoDB useful commands**

- Inserting a document: 
    - To insert a document into a collection, you can use the `db.collection.insertOne()` 
    or `db.collection.insertMany()` method.
    - For example, to insert a new document into a "users" collection, you could use the following command:
    
```java
db.users.insertOne({name: "John Doe", age: 30, email: "johndoe@example.com"})
```

- Finding documents: 
    - To find documents in a collection, you can use the `db.collection.find()` method.
    - For example, to find all documents in a "users" collection where the age is greater than 25, you could use the 
    following command:

```java
db.users.find({age: {$gt: 25}})
```

- Updating documents: 
    - To update documents in a collection, you can use the `db.collection.updateOne()` or `db.collection.updateMany()` 
    method.
    - For example, to update the email address of a user with the name "John Doe" in a "users" collection, 
    you could use the following command:

```java
db.users.updateOne({name: "John Doe"}, {$set: {email: "johndoe@example.com"}})
```

- Deleting documents: 
    - To delete documents from a collection, you can use the `db.collection.deleteOne()` or `db.collection.deleteMany()` 
    method.
    - For example, to delete all documents in a "users" collection where the age is less than 18, you could use the 
    following command:

```java
db.users.deleteMany({age: {$lt: 18}})
```

- Aggregation: 
    - To perform data aggregation in MongoDB, you can use the `db.collection.aggregate()` method along with pipeline 
    operators like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`, and `$project`.
    - For example, to find the average age of users in a "users" collection, you could use the following command:

```java
db.users.aggregate([
    {$group: {_id: null, avgAge: {$avg: "$age"}}},
    {$project: {_id: 0, avgAge: 1}}
])
```

**MongoDB in Java application**

```java
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoCollection;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;
import org.bson.Document;

public class MongoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Connect to MongoDB
        MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://localhost:27017");

        // Get the database
        MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");

        // Get the collection
        MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("users");

        // Insert a document
        Document user = new Document("name", "John Doe")
                .append("age", 30)
                .append("email", "johndoe@example.com");
        collection.insertOne(user);

        // Find all documents
        for (Document doc : collection.find()) {
            System.out.println(doc.toJson());
        }

        // Close the connection
        mongoClient.close();
    }
}
```

- This example demonstrates how to connect to a MongoDB instance running on the local machine on the default port 
(27017), how to get a reference to a database and a collection, and how to insert and retrieve documents.
- To run this example you need to have mongodb installed and running on your machine, and also you have to import the 
mongodb java driver in your classpath, you can find more information about the driver on the mongodb website.

**MongoDB Spring Framework**

- MongoDB can be easily integrated with Spring Framework using the Spring Data MongoDB project. 
- Spring Data MongoDB provides a high-level abstraction for working with MongoDB, making it easy to interact with the 
database using Spring's familiar Repository and Template patterns.
- Here are the steps to set up a Spring Boot application with MongoDB using Spring Data MongoDB:
    - Add the Spring Data MongoDB dependency to your pom.xml file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

- Add the MongoDB connection properties to your `application.properties` file. For example:

```
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost/test
```

- Create a Java POJO class representing the document you want to store in MongoDB, and annotate it with `@Document`.
- Create a repository interface that extends `MongoRepository<T, ID>` or `PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID>`, where `T` 
is the type of the document class, and ID is the type of the document's ID.
- Autowire the repository into your service or controller class and use it to interact with the database.
- Run your Spring Boot application.
- Here is an example of a simple Spring Boot application that uses Spring Data MongoDB to store and retrieve Person 
documents:

```java
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends MongoRepository<Person, String> { }
```

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class PersonController {
    @Autowired
    private PersonRepository repository;

    @GetMapping("/persons")
    public Iterable<Person> getAll() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }
}
```

- This is a basic example to get you started, in a real-world application you may need to add validation, 
exception handling and other features to make it robust, but it gives you an idea of how Spring Data MongoDB can be 
used to interact with MongoDB in a Spring application.

**SQL vs NoSQL dbs**

- SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are both used for storing and managing data, 
but they have some key differences.
- SQL databases are based on a relational model, where data is stored in tables and relationships are defined between 
the tables using primary keys and foreign keys. 
- SQL databases are often used for transactional systems, where data consistency and integrity are important. 
- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not follow the relational model and do not use a fixed schema. 
- Instead, they are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and can scale horizontally 
to handle high levels of traffic. 
- NoSQL databases are often used for big data and real-time applications, where performance and scalability are more 
important than data consistency and integrity. 
- Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.
- In summary, SQL databases are better suited for structured, transactional data and NoSQL databases are better suited 
for unstructured and high volume of data. 
- It is important to use the right type of database for the specific use case and requirements.

**When use SQL and NoSQL databases**

- When deciding whether to use a SQL or NoSQL database, it is important to consider the specific requirements of the 
application and the type of data that will be stored.
- Here are some examples of when to use a SQL database:
    - When you have structured data with a fixed schema, and you need to enforce data consistency and integrity. 
    - SQL databases are well suited for transactional systems where data is inserted, updated, and deleted in a 
    consistent and controlled manner.
    - When you need to perform complex queries and joins on multiple tables. 
    - SQL databases are optimized for this type of operation and provide a rich set of query languages like SQL to do so.
    - When you have a small to medium size of data. 
    - SQL databases work well with a small to medium amount of data and the performance of the queries will be consistent.
- And here are some examples of when to use a NoSQL database:
    - When you have unstructured or semi-structured data that does not fit into a fixed schema. 
    - NoSQL databases are designed to handle this type of data and can be easily adapted to changing data structures.
    - When you need to scale horizontally to handle high levels of traffic. 
    - NoSQL databases are built to handle a large number of requests, and can easily scale out by adding more servers to 
    the cluster.
    - When you need low latency and high performance. 
    - NoSQL databases are optimized for read and write operations, and can provide faster performance than SQL databases 
    for certain types of workloads.
- It's worth noting that many modern databases are now hybrid and can have features from both types of databases, 
for example: MongoDB, Cassandra, and CosmosDB, provide SQL like query languages for querying the data but still the 
underlying architecture is a NoSQL.

**Openshift**

- OpenShift is a container orchestration platform developed by Red Hat. 
- It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides additional features for managing and deploying containerized applications.
- OpenShift provides a web-based user interface and command-line tools for managing and deploying containerized 
applications. 
- It also includes features such as automatic scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing to make it easier to deploy 
and manage containerized applications in production environments.
- OpenShift also includes built-in support for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) which makes it 
easier to automate the build, test, and deployment of applications. 
- It also allows you to use your choice of development languages and frameworks, including Java, Ruby, and Python.
- OpenShift also provides a built-in service catalog that allows developers to easily discover and use services, 
such as databases and message queues, provided by the platform.
- OpenShift is a powerful platform for managing and deploying containerized applications and it is widely used in 
enterprise environments.

***

**Process Structure**

- In a multithreaded context, a process typically includes several key data structures:
    - Process Table: This table contains information about each process currently running on the system, 
    such as the process ID, memory address space, and state of the process (e.g. running, blocked, etc.).
    - Thread Table: This table contains information about each thread within a process, such as the thread ID, 
    program counter, and stack pointer.
    - File Table: This table contains information about files that are currently open by the process, including the 
    file descriptor, file pointer, and access permissions.
    - Memory Management Data Structures: These data structures, such as page tables and memory maps, are used to manage 
    the memory used by the process and its threads.
    - Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Data Structures: These data structures, such as semaphores, message queues, 
    and shared memory, are used to facilitate communication and synchronization between processes and threads.

***

**Avro**

- Apache Avro is a data serialization system that provides a compact, fast, and binary format for data. 
- It is often used in big data and distributed systems to efficiently serialize data for storage and transmission.
- Avro provides a schema-based system, which means that the structure of the data is defined in a JSON-based schema. 
- This allows for compatibility between different languages and systems, as the schema can be shared and used to read 
and write the data.
- Avro also includes a built-in support for data evolution, which means that the schema can be changed over time without 
breaking compatibility with existing data.
- Avro is widely used in various big data technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive and Apache NiFi.
- In Kafka, Avro is used to serialize and deserialize messages in a compact binary format, which makes it a good choice 
for high-throughput data streams.
- In Hadoop, Avro is used as the default data storage format in the AvroFileInputFormat and AvroFileOutputFormat classes 
of the Hadoop MapReduce framework.
- In Hive, Avro is used as a storage format for Hive tables and can be used in conjunction with the AvroSerDe 
(serializer/deserializer) to read and write Avro data.
- In Apache NiFi, Avro is used as a data format for data transmission in NiFi flows, for example for data ingestions, 
conversions, transformations and more.
- Overall, Avro is a powerful and flexible data serialization system that is well-suited for use in big data 
and distributed systems where efficient storage and transmission of data is critical.

***

**Java compile time vs runtime**

- In Java, the terms "compile-time" and "runtime" refer to different stages of the execution of a program.
- Compile-time refers to the stage of program execution where the source code is translated into machine-readable code 
(bytecode) by the Java compiler. 
- During this stage, the compiler checks for syntax errors, type errors, and other issues in the source code. 
- If any errors are found, the compiler will generate error messages and the program will not be able to be compiled.
- Runtime refers to the stage of program execution where the compiled bytecode is executed by the 
Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
- During this stage, the program is executed as intended, provided that there are no errors in the bytecode. 
- The JVM also checks for errors during runtime, such as null pointer exceptions, and generates error messages if any 
are found.
- It's worth noting that some errors can be only detected at runtime, such as a `ClassNotFoundException that can be 
thrown when a class is not found at runtime.
- In general, it's better to catch errors at compile-time, as it makes debugging and maintaining the code easier.

***

**Spring Framework**

- In Spring Framework, a REST controller is a class that handles HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. 
- It is typically used to handle incoming requests to a web application and return an appropriate response, 
such as an HTML page, JSON data, or a file.
- A REST controller is typically defined using the `@RestController` annotation, which is a combination of the 
`@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations. 
- The `@Controller` annotation is used to indicate that the class is a controller, and the `@ResponseBody` annotation 
is used to indicate that the method's return value should be written to the response body.
- Here is an example of a simple REST controller that handles incoming GET requests to the "/hello" endpoint and returns 
a greeting message:

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

- In this example, the `@RestController` annotation indicates that the class is a REST controller and the 
`@GetMapping("/hello")` annotation indicates that the `sayHello()` method should handle GET requests to the 
"/hello" endpoint.
- When a GET request is sent to the "/hello" endpoint, the `sayHello()` method is invoked and the string "Hello, World!" 
is returned as the response.
- Another example, here is a REST controller that receives a POST request to the "/users" endpoint, 
it will parse the request body as a json and create the user in the database and return the created user as json

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UserController {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @PostMapping("/users")
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

- This is a simple example of how a REST controller in Spring Framework works. 
- In a real-world application, you would typically need to handle more complex scenarios, such as handling different 
HTTP methods, validating request data, handling errors, and so on.
- You can also use other annotations such as `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, `@PatchMapping` to handle different 
http methods, and other annotations like `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam` to get the variables from the path and the 
query parameters.

**CORS**

- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that blocks web pages from 
making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. 
- This is done to prevent malicious sites from stealing sensitive information from other sites.
- However, some web applications need to make requests to different domains. 
- For example, a web application running on `http://example.com` may need to make requests to a REST API running on 
`http://api.example.com`. 
- CORS allows the server to specify which origins are allowed to make requests to the server.
- CORS is implemented using HTTP headers, the server can include the following headers in its responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header specifies which origins are allowed to make requests to the server.
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header specifies which HTTP methods are allowed for the specified origins.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header specifies which headers are allowed for the specified origins.
```

- For example, if you want to allow requests from any origin, you can include the following headers in your server 
responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

- This will allow any origin to make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests to the server and include a 
`Content-Type` header in the request.
- Spring framework have `@CrossOrigin` annotation, it can be added to the controllers or the methods to allow a specific 
origin or all origins to access the resources.

```java
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://example.com")
@RestController
public class MyController {
    //...
}
```

- This allows requests from `http://example.com` to access the resources of the controller.
- Please note that setting the headers alone is not enough to allow cross-origin requests, 
the browser will still block the requests, the headers are just a way for the server to tell the browser that it is 
allowed to make the request.

**Nginx**

- When developing a web application, it is typically run on a local development server on a specific port such as 8080. 
- However, when deploying the application to a production environment, you will want it to be accessible to the outside 
world on a standard port such as 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
- Here are a few ways to make your web application accessible to the outside world on a standard port:
    - Use a reverse proxy: 
        - A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of your web application and forwards incoming requests to your 
        application. 
        - The reverse proxy can be configured to listen on port 80 or 443 and forward requests to your application 
        running on a different port. 
        - Popular reverse proxy servers include Nginx and Apache.
    - Use a load balancer: 
        - A load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure that your application can 
        handle high traffic. 
        - Load balancers can also be configured to listen on port 80 or 443 and forward requests to your application 
        running on a different port.
    - Use a cloud service: 
        - Some cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform offer services that allow you to 
        expose your application to the internet on a standard port without the need to configure a reverse proxy or 
        load balancer.
    - Change your application to listen on port 80 or 443: 
        - In some cases, you may be able to change your application to listen on port 80 or 443 directly. 
        - However, this is not recommended as ports below 1024 are typically reserved for privileged services and 
        require root or administrator privileges to bind to.
- It's worth noting that you should make sure that your application is secured and follow best practices for securing 
your web application.
- Please keep in mind that, depending on your infrastructure, there may be other factors that impact your ability to make 
your web application visible to the outside world on a standard port, such as firewall rules or network configurations.

**Nginx config**

```
# HTTPS server
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/ssl/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ssl/private.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

- In this example, Nginx is configured to listen on port 443 (HTTPS) and forward incoming requests to the localhost on 
port 8080. 
- The `proxy_pass` directive is used to specify the target URL, which is the localhost on port 8080 in this case. 
- The `proxy_set_header` directives are used to pass along the original client's host, IP address and `X-Forwarded-For` 
headers to the proxied server.
- It's worth noting that you will need to configure SSL certificate and private key to use HTTPS protocol.
- You can also redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS by adding this block in your configuration

```
# HTTP server
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

- This block listen to port 80 and redirect all the incoming traffic to the HTTPS server.
- It's important to note that this is a basic example, and you will likely need to make additional configuration changes 
to suit your specific use case. 
- You should also test your configuration to make sure that it is working as expected.

**X-Real-IP**

- `X-Real-IP` is an HTTP header field that is used to indicate the IP address of the client that is making the request. 
- When a request passes through a proxy server, the IP address of the client is replaced with the IP address of the 
proxy server. 
- This makes it difficult to determine the original client's IP address. 
- The X-Real-IP header is used to pass the original client's IP address along with the request so that it can be used by 
the server that receives the request.
- In the example, the `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;` directive is used to set the `X-Real-IP` header to the 
value of the `$remote_addr` variable, which contains the IP address of the client that is making the request. 
- This allows the application server running on port 8080 to see the IP address of the original client rather than 
the IP address of the proxy server.
- It's worth noting that this header is non-standard and is not part of the HTTP specification, but it's commonly used 
in web server and proxy server configurations.
- Additionally, `X-Real-IP` header is useful in tracking the real IP of the client, in situations like rate limiting, 
access restriction, logging, etc.
