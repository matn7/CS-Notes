## Linux Version

- The Unix operating system was released by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of AT@T Bell Lab in 1970
- Unix was later rewritten in C, to make it portable
- In 1977 Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) was developed
- In 1985 Intel released the 80386, the first x86 microprocessor
- Commercial Unix was too expensive for private users using Intel 386 PCs
- In 1987, Andrew Tanebaum released MINIX, a Unix like system intended for academic use
    - Source code was available, but modification and redistribution was restricted
    - The 16 bit design of MINIX was not well suited for the 32 bit design of the cheap and popular Intel 386 PCs
- In 1991 Linus Torvalds released a project called 'Freax' which later become Linux
- In 1992 Torvalds released the Linux kernel under GNU license
- Initially Linux only referred to the kernel, not the distribution as a whole (shell, compilers, editors)
- The Debian project started in 1993 to create a distribution of GNU tools (shell, compilers, editors) and was called
GNU/Linux
