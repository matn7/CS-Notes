# Interfaces and lambdas

- Interfaces can determine what should be implemented without creating an implementation.

- Interface determines the sets of methods that implemented class has to deliver.

- Interfaces is super type for each class that implements it. This is the reason why we can assign class instance, which type is determined by interface.

- Interface can contains static methods. All interface variables are automatically static and final.

- Interface can contain default methods.
