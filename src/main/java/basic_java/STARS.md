## :star: Immutable class

### With final class

```java
public final class Complex {
    /**
     * Rules:
     * 1. No setter methods
     * 2. Declare class as final to prevent inheritance
     * 3. All fields as final
     * 4. All fields as private
     * 5. Return new object in all calls
     */

    private final float re;
    private final float im;

    public Complex(float re, float im) {
        this.re = re;
        this.im = im;
    }

    // only getters
    public float getRe() {
        return re;
    }

    public float getIm() {
        return im;
    }

    // Return new Complex object
    public Complex add(Complex c) {
        return new Complex(re + c.re, im + c.im);
    }
}
```

- Add operation creates and return new object without modify current object.
- Immutable objects are simple. They have exactly one state one that was created.
- Immutable objects are thread safe, don't requires synchronization.

### Class no final but with static factory method

```java
public class Complex2 {
    /**
     * Rules:
     * 1. No setter methods
     * 3. All fields as final
     * 4. All fields as private
     * 5. Return new object in all calls
     */

    private final float re;
    private final float im;

    private Complex2(float re, float im) {
        this.re = re;
        this.im = im;
    }

    // only getters
    public float getRe() {
        return re;
    }

    public float getIm() {
        return im;
    }

    // Return new Complex object
    public static Complex2 valueOf(float re, float im) {
        return new Complex2(re, im);
    }
}
```

- Alternative for declare class as final. Declare all constructors as private or protected
next add public static factory methods.

### Rules

- Class should be immutable
- All fields should be final

## :star: Find the maximum depth of a binary tree

    }

    // Find the max depth on the left and right subtrees. Add 1 to account for the current depth of the tree
    int leftMaxDepth = 1 + maxDepth(root.getLeftChild());
    int rightMaxDepth = 1 + maxDepth(root.getRightChild());
    return Math.max(leftMaxDepth, rightMaxDepth);   // Find the max depth between the left and right subtrees
}

## :star: equals

- By default equals comparing a object by comparing their address in memory
- By default equals method tests for object identity it returns true if and only if the 2 objects are literally the same (point to the same location in memory).
- In flyweight pattern we need this method to return true if the 2 objects have the same value, even if they are actually different objects.
- The default implementation of .equals() relies on object identity, which may cause problems if we end up with multiple flyweights referring to the same underlying value.
- Concurrency issues sometimes give rise to decouple flyweight - there duplicates are fine so long as they return true when called .equals()

```java
public class Item {
    private String desc;
    private double price;

    public boolean equals(Object otherObject) {
        // check whether objects are equals
        if (this == otherObject) return true;

        // Must return false if parameter is null
        if (otherObject == null) return false;

        // Check whether object is instance of Item class
        if (getClass() != otherObject.getClass()) return false;

        // Check value
        Item other = (Item) otherObject;
        return Object.equals(desc == other.desc && price == other.price);
    }
}

## :star: Object Class Methods

### hashCode

- HashCode if two objects are equals then their hashCode values should be equals as well,
so if implement just equals method and leave hashCode unimplemented the hashCode will always
**create 2 students** objects as if they are different objects. Even when their enrId are the same.
- If two objects are equal, then their hashCode values must also be equal. Whenever you implement equals(Object), you must also implement hashCode().
- For List Collection, even if you had not implement hashCode method in the Student class you would have a true in return.
If your entity will be part of a Set collection, override its equals and hashCode methods.

### toString

### equals

### wait and notify
- work in tandem â€“ when one thread calls wait() on an object, that thread will block until
  another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on that same object.

### getClass

### clone
- For the method to be used all classes calling the method must implement the Cloneable interface

### Object constructor
- All constructors in Java must make a call to the Object constructor. This is done with the call super().
This has to be the first line in a constructor. The reason for this is so that the object can actually be created on the heap before
any additional initialization is performed.

### finalize
- This is a protected and non-static method of the Object class. s. This method is used to perform some final operations
or clean up operations on an object before it gets removed from memory.
According to the doc, this method gets called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage
collection determines that there are no more references to the object.
But there are no guarantees that finalize() method would gets called if the object is still reachable or no Garbage
Collectors run when the object become eligible. That's why it's better not rely on this method.
Generally it's considered bad practice to use finalize() method in applications of any kind and should be avoided.
Finalizers are not meant for freeing resources (e.g., closing files). The garbage collector gets called when (if!) the
system runs low on heap space. You can't rely on it to be called when the system is running low on file handles or,
for any other reason.
The intended use-case for finalizers is for an object that is about to be reclaimed to notify some other object about
its impending doom. A better mechanism now exists for that purpose---the java.lang.ref.WeakReference<T>
class. If you think you need write a finalize() method, then you should look into whether you can solve the same
problem using WeakReference instead. If that won't solve your problem, then you may need to re-think your design
on a deeper level.

## :star: Concurrent Collections

### Thread Safe collections
```java
List<String> threadSafeList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<String>());
Set<String> threadSafeSet = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<String>());
Map<String, String> threadSafeMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<String, String>());
```
- Since Java 5
```java
List<String> threadSafeList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<String>();
Set<String> threadSafeSet = new ConcurrentHashSet<String>();
Map<String, String> threadSafeMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, String>();
```

- ConcurrentHashMap insertions
SomeObject previousValue = concurrentHashMap.putIfAbsent(1, value);

### Concurrent Collections
Concurrent collections are a generalization of thread-safe collections, that allow for a broader usage in a concurrent
environment.
While thread-safe collections have safe element addition or removal from multiple threads, they do not necessarily
have safe iteration in the same context (one may not be able to safely iterate through the collection in one thread,
while another one modifies it by adding/removing elements).
<br/>
**java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList**
The "snapshot" style iterator method uses a reference to the state of the array at the point that the
iterator was created. This array never changes during the lifetime of the iterator, so interference is
impossible and the iterator is guaranteed not to throw ConcurrentModificationException.
<br/>
**ConcurrentLinkedQueue**
Iterators are weakly consistent, returning elements reflecting the state of the queue at some point at or
since the creation of the iterator. They do not throw java.util.ConcurrentModificationException, and may
proceed concurrently with other operations. Elements contained in the queue since the creation of the
iterator will be returned exactly once.
<br/>
```java
public static final List<Integer> LIST = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
```
Could (and statistically will on most modern, multi CPU/core architectures) lead to exceptions.
Synchronized collections from the Collections utility methods are thread safe for addition/removal of elements,
but not iteration (unless the underlying collection being passed to it already is).

## :star: WeakHashMap

Weak References : The objects that are referenced only by weak references are garbage collected eagerly; the GC
wonâ€™t wait until it needs memory in that case.
<br/>
**Difference between Hashmap and WeakHashMap:**<br/>
If the Java memory manager no longer has a strong reference to the object specified as a key, then the entry in the
map will be removed in WeakHashMap.

## :star: Rules that Relational Database follows

- **Entity Integrity** : Every table has a primary key.
- **Referential Integrity** : A foreign key points at a value that is the primary key of another table. Null value are valid for FK.

***

## :star: object states
- Transient state - object does not associated with any table row
- Persistent - object with database identify. Primary key is set as database identifier.
- Detached - no longer managed by EntityManager. setText will only change state in JVM memory.

## :star: Declaring a **volatile** Java variable

Means the value of this variable will never be called
thread-locally all reads and writes will go straight to "main memory". Access to the variable
acts as through it is enclosed in a synchronized block, synchronized on itself.
<br/>
- A class loader is a part of JVM. Technically namespaces are unique per class loader.
Usually there is just 1 class loader per program.
<br/>
- In Java Threading support, thread mostly communicate with each other via shared objects or shared member variables with the same object.
    - Thread interference : different thread access the same data
    - Memory Consistency Errors : A thread sees a state inconsistent value of a variable
    - Thread Contention : Thread get in each other's way, and slow down-or sometimes even have to be killed in Java
- Thread interference and memory consistency errors
    - If two thread access the same variable, it's possible for them to get in each other's way
      That's because Java might switch execution from one thread to another even midway through a simple, seemingly atomic instruction.
    - For example two threads incrementing the same variable could simply lose one of the two increments.
    - Restricting access to an object or a variable-akin to locking the variable so only thread can access at a time
      is a powerful concept used widely in computer science especially in databases.
    - Locking variables correctly can eliminate thread interference and memory consistency error
        - But it slows down performance and can lead to thread contention issues (starvation, livelock, deadlock)

## :star: What is the best way to subclass Singleton?

- Singleton classes should never be subclassed or extended
- Every object in Java has a lock associated with it.
    - This lock is called the intrinsic lock or monitor.
    - This lock is usually always open, any number of threads can access the object simultaneously.
    - It is possible to specify that a thread can only execute a section of code once it has acquired the lock on source object.
    - If some other thread currently holds that lock, the current thread must wait its turn
    **This is achieved using the Synchronized keyword**

## :star: Synchronized

### methods

- Any method in java can be marked as synchronized
- Only one thread at a time only applies to the same method of the same object
- Only one thread can be executing this member function on this object at a given point in time
- So for instance if the same method does something to a static class variable (not an object variable), errors can still result
- Used right making a method as synchronized can help eliminate thread interference and memory consistency error.

```java
public class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int c = 0;
    public synchronized void increment() {
        c++;
    }

    public synchronized void decrement() {
        c--;
    }

    public synchronized int value() {
        return c;
    }
}
```

### blocks of code

- Since every object in Java has an intrinsic lock associated with it, it is possible to lock
  any section of code by making it as synchronized.
- Any object can be used as lock using a synchronized statement

```java
public void addName(String name) {
    synchronized(this) {
        lastName = name;
        nameCount++;
    }
    nameList.add(name);
}
```
- Threads never gets blocked on itself which means that one synchronized method of an object can always call
  another synchronized method of the same object without blocking.
- Making method as synchronized is a shortcut to making the entire body of the method as synchronized
  on "THIS"


### Thread Contention

| Deadlock | Two thread each is blocked on a lock held by the other |
|---|---|
| Livelock | Two thread don't deadlock, but keep blocking on locks held by each other, neither really can progress |
| Starvation | Some threads keep acquiring locks greedly. And cause other threads to be unable to get anything done |

## :star: Make sure your singleton objects can't be cloned

- 1. The .clone() method belongs to object class (every object has this method), when it ought to belong to cloneable interface
- 2. Object have a clone method, but if you try to clone an object that does not implement cloneable, a not cloneable exception is thrown
- 3. So make sure that your singleton class does not implement cloneable - or if for some reason it does
Override the clone() method to thrown an exception.

## :star: Which of following is true?

- The clone method is in the Object class, which means all objects have a .clone() method
- Singletons should never implement cloneable
- Calling .clone() on an object that does not explicitly implement the method result in an exception
- The volatile keyword ensures a variable is never cached, and only read from main memory
- Access to variable marked volatile is synchronized on the variable itself
- Variable marked volatile are safe to use in different threads
- The .clone() method is in object class, which means all objects have a .clone() method
- The .clone() method sits in the cloneable interface, so objects that implement this interface posses a .clone()
- Calling .clone() on an object that does not explicitly implement the method result in an exception
