ConcurrentHashMap

* Supports full concurrency during retreval. Retreival operations do not block even if adds are running concurrently.

* Reads can happen fast, while writes require a lock. Write lock is acquired at granural level whole table is not
  locked only segments are locked. So very rare chance of read waiting on write to complete.

* Iterations do not throw concurrent modification exception (fail safe).

* Can be used in cases where a lot of concurrent addition happened followed by concurrent reads later on.

* Null key not alowed. (not sure if null mapped or not to null value).

* Operations are atomic.
