# ClassCastException

* When references to objects ponits to objects different classes
* When argument if wrong type, method compareTo should throw exception
* No expliit casting
* Try add wrond data type
* SerialVersionUID


# Constructor Chaining

* Call in the same class this()
* Call from parent class super()
* Use to execute more tasks in one constructor
* Improver readability of code


# Overloading

* Compile time polymorphism
* Use the same method name but with different arguments


# Overriding

* Runtime polymorphism
* The same method name with exactly the same arguments


# final

* Value of member variable cannot be changed
* Object reference cannot be changed
* Class cannot be inherited
* Method cannot be overriden


# finally

* Try, catch, block. Stuff between {} in finnaly always be executed, even when in try return statement
* Finnaly want execute. Program crasch before go to this block, or in try System.exit(0)


# finalize

* JVM call this method when GC is about to e called


# == vs equals

* == check wether object are the same (point to the same place in memory, the same object)
* .equals() when compare content of objects


# Class Loaders

* Bootstrap Class Loader
* Extension Class Loader
* System Class Loader


# SerialVersionUID

* Mark added to class to during deserialization, reconstruct good class. Useful when there is some class hierarchies
parent class, child class


# hashCode, equals

* You must override hashcode in every class that overrides equals. Failure to do so affect working with hashbasec collection
HashMap, HashSet
