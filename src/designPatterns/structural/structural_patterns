# Decorator Pattern
Dynamically add responsibilities to objects
On example File API in Java
Adding new functionality to existing class should be easily done while extending the class
inherited from it we use it within a composite or any other way. You should not force user
to modfy this class in order to change functionality, Java does it via Decorator Pattern.
